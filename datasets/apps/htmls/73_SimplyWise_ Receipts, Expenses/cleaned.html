Personal Information, as more particularly described in the Applicable Privacy Laws, is information about an identifiable person that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context but does not include information of an aggregate or anonymous nature where a specific individual or individuals cannot be identified. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information and Personal Information collected through our app and website.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">What are Applicable Privacy Laws?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">What we mean by Applicable Privacy Laws are any and all applicable laws, regulations and policies, including US privacy and information security laws and regulations, relating to privacy and the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information in all applicable jurisdictions. For greater clarity, Applicable Privacy Laws may mean something different to each of the users of our service or visitors to our website, as each visitor or user may be protected by different legal requirements in relation to privacy that are unique to the jurisdiction (e.g. state, country) in which they reside.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">To the extent you provide it, when registering or seeking information on our site or app, we collect your name, mobile phone number and email address.

We use that phone number to identify you, to provide you 2FA services, and to maintain logs for security and anti-fraud purposes.</li><li>We may also use that number to provide you with customer support or service offerings, including responding to and resolving your inquiries and requests via email or text-based chat.</li><li>We may administer a contest, promotion, survey or other app or site feature.</li><li>We may send periodic emails or text messages regarding your order or other products and services.</li></ul><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Do you have to share Personal Information?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">While you may access certain information contained on our app or site without providing Personal Information, you may choose to provide Personal Information when you use the tools and services on our app or site. Accuracy of the Personal Information you submit will impact the usefulness of the services we provide to you.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Our app or site may contain links to public discussion forums online. Should you choose to share your personal information in such a public discussion forum, your information will be open to the public and should not be considered private, in which case SimplyWise has no control over, nor any responsibility or liability for that information. Sharing personal information is entirely voluntary and your decision.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">How do we protect your information?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">SimplyWise uses a variety of security measures designed to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of the Personal Information it collects and maintains.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your Personal Information.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Please remember that no security measures are foolproof, and SimplyWise cannot guarantee that information will be protected in all situations. We will make reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Do we use 'cookies'?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser or app (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your account. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site or app activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site or app traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site and app experiences and tools in the future. Cookies do not collect personal information. They do collect information that includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">We use cookies to understand and save user preferences for future visits.</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">You can choose to have your computer or mobile phone warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">If users disable cookies in their browser:</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">If you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your experience with SimplyWise products more efficient may not function properly.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Third-party disclosure</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Third-party links</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Google</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en&amp;visit_id=637589595086256024-2977067589&amp;rd=1" style="color: blue;">here</a>.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">We have implemented the following:</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Opting out:</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">California Online Privacy Protection Act/European Union General Data Protection Regulation</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. Similarly the GDPR stretches well beyond the EU to provide certain protections to, and regulate the collection and processing of Personal Information of, EU Citizens and EU Residents by any person or company wherever located throughout the world. See more below.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">According to CalOPPA and the GDPR, we agree to the following:</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Users can visit our site anonymously. After this privacy policy was created, we added a link to it on our home page. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy page. You can change or delete your personal information by editing it in your account or by contacting support@simplywise.com. You can object to processing of your Personal Information, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Information or request portability of your Personal Information by contacting support@simplywise.com. If we have collected your Personal Information with your permission, you may withdraw your consent at any time (withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal nor does it affect the processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than your consent). For California residents, the above applies to the Personal Information collected form you during the 12 month period prior to the date of your request.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Fair Information Practices</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur. We will notify you via email or phone within 7 business days.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">CAN SPAM Act</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-80vkqw" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We collect your email address in order to:</p><ul><li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li><li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li></ul><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h6><ul><li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses</li><li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li><li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li><li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li><li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li><li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li></ul><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails or messages, you can email us at support@simplywise.com.</h6><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-gif58" style="margin-bottom: 10px;
