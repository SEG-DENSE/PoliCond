<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide, develop, and improve our products and services for you. For example, we store your data on our servers in order to allow you to stream videos, save content and share it with others with your permission</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pursue legitimate interests, including conducting research, helping us form business decisions, personalizing the services for you based on the types of devices you are using or the environment where you have your devices set up</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comply with legal obligations. For example, we may process your information in response to legal processes or law enforcement requests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with you, such as providing potentially practical tips and special offers for you</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address technical issues reported by you to improve functionalities and availabilities of the services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigate potential violations of Terms of Service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process and fulfill claims and orders in connection with our products and services and keep you informed about the status of your order</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the data we use for research and analyzing purposes are processed in a non-identifiable form, which means the information is processed anonymously and will never be associated with you. For example, we may track aggregated information like registration and validation rates to help us design more effective onboarding pages. We may also use a machine-learning algorithm to access the data automatically without manual operation and help us provide personalized services for specific groups of individuals. We use such information to help us increase sales, make marketing decisions, and pursue legitimate interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we may access your information in a personally identifiable way under the following circumstances: (1) when you encounter any technical issue and request that we address such issue; (2) when we investigate potential violations of Terms of Service; (3) when we have to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. Whenever your personal information is involved in any case stated above, we will always ask for your consent before taking any further action. Please also note that this principle is established for those who are in compliance with our Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may process the information on the platforms provided by third-party service providers. Though these service providers are shared with your personal information for the purpose of providing the services for us, they are restricted from sharing it for any other purpose.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take data security very seriously and keep the information obtained from you safe and secure in line with industry standards. Your personal information is encrypted while it is transmitted to our servers in order to prevent any unauthorized third parties or threats from accessing the data. Please note that we may process your personal information on servers not necessarily located in your home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our products and services are designed to provide you with the ability to see, hear, and speak to anyone on your monitoring device. In order for our products and services to function properly, we obtain content and related information that is captured and recorded when you use our products and services. For example, we store the events captured by the motion detector in our servers in order to provide evidence to identify the suspect. In addition, our products and services may also collect data from their surrounding environment to perform certain functions (such as Activity Detection and Auto Low-Light Filter that is activated automatically when it’s unlit).</span></p>
