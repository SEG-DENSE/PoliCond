If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>We care a lot about privacy</strong>. We are committed to creating spaces where people can talk, hang out and have fun with friends online. Respecting user privacy is a key part of <a href="https://discord.com/safety-privacy">that mission</a>.</li><li><strong>We don’t sell your personal information</strong>. Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties.</li><li><strong>We limit what information is required</strong>. We require the information that enables us to create your account, provide and maintain our services, meet our commitments to our users, and satisfy our legal requirements. The rest is optional.</li><li><strong>We care deeply about safety</strong>. Our dedicated Trust and Safety team works hard to help keep our community safe. We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. </li><li><strong>We give you control</strong>. We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord.</li></ul></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="2"><h2>Discord is the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online</h2><p>We created Discord to be the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to connect with friends.</p><p>Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too.</p><p>As explained in our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time.</p><p>We may also use content posted in larger spaces to help us develop, improve and power our services, including features that help you catch up on conversations and safety features that identify harmful content on the services and support the enforcement of our <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>. These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You can learn more about our approach to safety and content moderation, including how we use your information for these purposes, in our <a href="https://discord.com/safety/our-approach-to-content-moderation">Safety Center</a>. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.</p><p>We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="3"><h2>The information we collect</h2><p>We collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.</p><h4>Information you provide to us</h4><ul role="list"><li><strong>Account information</strong>. When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, we may require additional information to verify your age. You may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or choose a display name.</li><li><strong>Content you create</strong>. This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, or post other content that you create with features that we develop. You may also upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings.</li><li><strong>Payment information</strong>. If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If you sell something through Discord, you may be required to provide additional information to Discord or to our payment processors, such as bank account information to facilitate payments, tax identification information, and copies of government issued identification required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves.</li><li><strong>Information from actions you take</strong>. We collect information about your use of Discord and your activities on the services. This includes information such as the friends you add, the users, bots, and apps you engage with, the games you play on your device, the servers or other communities you join and participate in, your roles in servers, content moderation decisions you make, information about purchases or sales you make on or through Discord including what you purchased or sold, and other related actions. You can control the extent to which we collect, use, and display this information as described in the “<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004109911-Data-Privacy-Controls">How to control your privacy</a>” section below.</li><li><strong>Information from optional features</strong>. Certain features, like contact syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make them work. This also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).</li><li><strong>Other information you provide directly to us</strong>. You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Discord. For example, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Discord Support teams.</li></ul><h4>Information we collect automatically</h4><p>We also collect information automatically from you when you use Discord. This includes:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Information about your device</strong>. We collect information about the device you are using to access the services. For example, this includes information like your IP address, operating system information, browser information, and information about your device settings, such as your microphone and/or camera. </li><li><strong>Information about your use of the apps or websites</strong>. For example, we collect log and event information related to how and when you use our services (such as the pages, servers, and channels you visit, the activities you engage in, the features you use, and the surfaces or embedded content you interact with).</li><li><strong>Other information that we collect automatically</strong>. When you take certain actions on other sites, we may receive information about you. For example, when we advertise for Discord on third party platforms, if you click on the ad, we may receive information about which ad you saw and on which platform. Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you came from.</li></ul><p>We may receive information from cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and similar technologies. You can find out more about Discord’s cookie usage and how you can manage your cookie permissions in our <a href="https://discord.com/terms/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><h4>Information we receive from other sources</h4><p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, if you interact with our social media account on another platform, we may receive certain information about you like your username on that platform.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="4"><h2>How we use your information</h2><p>Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. Discord relies on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We use the Information We Collect—<a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Account%20information.">Account information</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=a%20display%20name.-,Content%20you%20create.,-This%20includes%20any">Content you create</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=you%20create%20servers.-,Payment%20information.,-If%20you%20buy">Payment information</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Information%20from%20actions%20you%20take.">Information from actions you take</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Information%20used%20to%20enable%20optional%20features.">Information used to enable optional features</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Other%20information%20you%20provide%20directly%20to%20us.">Other information you provide directly to us</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Information%20about%20your%20device.">Information about your device</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Information%20about%20your%20use%20of%20the%20apps%20or%20websites.">Information about your use of the apps or websites</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Other%20information%20that%20we%20collect%20automatically.">other information that we collect automatically</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#:~:text=Cookie%20Policy.-,Information%20we%20receive%20from%20other%20sources,We%20may%20receive,-information%20about%20you">Information we receive from other sources</a>—for the following reasons and according to these legal bases. For each reason, we describe why we process your information and how we process your information to achieve each purpose.</p><p>‍<strong>To fulfill our contract with you</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>To provide you with the services</strong>. We use your information to provide you with the Discord services. For example, when you start a video call, we process your images and audio to make that work. We similarly collect and store the messages you send and display them as you direct. We also use the information you provide to us to create and manage your account and to facilitate purchases. When you enable optional features (like connecting your Discord account to other platforms), we use information from those services to power the feature (like displaying what song you are listening to on another service within the Discord app).</li><li><strong>To meet our commitments to the Discord community</strong>. We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place. To do so, we use your information to monitor for and take action against users and content that violate our <a href="http://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420312247575">other policies</a>. This includes responding to user reports, generating transcriptions of content as part of our investigation, detecting fraud and malware, and proactively scanning attachments and other content for illegal or harmful activity. We also use certain information, which may include content reported to us, content that violates our <a href="http://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, and certain other content widely available on the service (such as public posts, usernames, avatars, banners, user profiles, server names, server icons, and server banners), <a href="https://discord.com/privacy#2">to create systems and models</a> that can be automated to more swiftly detect, categorize, and take action against prohibited content or conduct.</li><li><strong>To contact you</strong>. We use your information to contact you in connection with your account, such as to verify or secure it with two-factor authentication. We may also use your information to contact you about important product or policy changes and to send you information about products you have purchased.</li><li><strong>To provide customer service</strong>. We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues.</li></ul><p><strong>For our legitimate business interests</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>To protect our services</strong>. We use your information to keep our services secure, to prevent misuse, and to enforce our Terms of Service and other policies against users who violate them.</li><li><strong>To report on our company’s performance</strong>. We use your information to track the fundamental metrics of our business, to perform financial reporting, to respond to regulatory obligations, and to debug billing issues.</li><li><strong>To personalize the product</strong>. We use your information to personalize our services. This information is used to customize your experience on Discord such as what you see on our discovery surfaces (so that you see relevant communities, activities, applications, or content first) or features that highlight activity on Discord that may interest you. This information also helps us surface Discord features and promotions from us and our partners that may be of interest to you. As discussed in the “<a href="https://discord.com/privacy#8">How to control your privacy</a>” section below, you can choose to what extent we will use your personal information to personalize your Discord experience.</li><li><strong>To improve our services</strong>. We use your information to help us understand how users interact with our services, what features or products users may want, to develop features that make Discord safer and better to use, or to otherwise understand and improve our services. This includes information about how you use our services and how servers are structured. We may also use certain content that is widely available to better understand, for example, what topics servers cover and what content is most interesting within those servers. Similarly, you can limit to what extent we use your personal information for these purposes.</li><li><strong>To advertise our services on Discord and other platforms</strong>. We are proud of the product we've built. We may tell you about our paid services and other features directly in the services and through our own channels, and we spend money advertising Discord on other platforms. As part of that, we use certain information to assist in the delivery of our advertising, to measure the effectiveness of advertisements for our own products, and to improve such advertisements in the future.</li><li><strong>To contact you</strong>. We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you’ll like, to ask you for feedback about our services, or to tell you about experiments that might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications.</li></ul><p><strong>To comply with our legal obligations</strong></p><p>We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity.</p><p>‍<strong>With your consent</strong></p><p>‍We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information.</p><p>‍<strong>To protect someone’s vital interests</strong></p><p>We may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger—for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="5"><h2>How we disclose your information</h2><ul role="list"><li><strong>When you tell us to</strong>. When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, interact with third party content posted on Discord, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so.</li><li><strong>With our vendors</strong>. We may provide information to vendors we hire to carry out specific work for us. This includes payment processors like Stripe and PayPal that process transactions on our behalf and cloud providers like Google that host our data and our services. We may also provide limited information to advertising platforms to help us reach people that we think will like our products and to measure the performance of our ads shown on those platforms. We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord.</li><li><strong>To comply with the law</strong>. We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is required by law, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. Where allowed and feasible, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our <a href="https://discord.com/safety-transparency">Transparency Report</a> has additional information about how we respond to requests from governments and law enforcement entities.</li><li><strong>In an emergency</strong>. We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to prevent serious harm to a person.</li><li><strong>To enforce our policies and rights</strong>. We may disclose information if needed to enforce our <a href="http://www.discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="http://www.discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>, any of our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420312247575">other policies</a>, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li><li><strong>With our related companies</strong>. We may provide information to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4410339409047">our related companies</a>, including parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li><li><strong>Sale, Acquisition, or Transfer of Assets</strong>. We may disclose information if Discord is evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale, transfer, or change in ownership of Discord or any of its assets.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information</strong>. We may disclose information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our business, features, or promotions to partners or the public.</li></ul></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="6"><h2>Data retention</h2><p>We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5431812448791">our data retention policy</a>.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="7"><h2>How we protect your information</h2><p>We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. For example, we use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt text and images in transit. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication">configuring two-factor authentication</a>.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="8"><h2>How to control your privacy</h2><p>We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below.</p><p>‍<strong>Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in</strong></p><p>You can choose what spaces to participate in and what information you add to our services. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone. </p><p>‍<strong>Customize your personal Discord settings</strong></p><p>We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username).</p><p>You can also access other privacy-related settings in your User Settings. For example, you can decide whether to filter potentially explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services</strong>.

For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services.</p><p>These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal">Developer Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy">Developer Policy</a>). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general.</p></div><div class="rich-guidlines-negative w-richtext" id="11"><h2>Data Protection Officer</h2><p>You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:dpo@discord.com">dpo@discord.com</a>.</p><p>We’ve appointed VeraSafe as Discord’s representative in the United Kingdom for data protection matters, pursuant to Article 27 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation.
