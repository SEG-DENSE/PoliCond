Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If you allow collection on the Sites when accessing via your mobile web browser, your location may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or if your browser blocks the collection by default, then only your general location information is collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you searched (i.e., “contextual location”).</li><li><strong>Apps Use of Location Information</strong>&nbsp;- If you access the Services on your mobile device or automotive infotainment system and consent to sharing location information with our App, we may collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via GPS, cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter or information about the vehicle. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow any of our mobile or in-vehicle Apps to directly collect location information while the App is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your settings or by deleting the App. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive select alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for the Apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services, (last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.</li><li><strong>Data Vendor Use of Location Information</strong>&nbsp;- Our service providers, and&nbsp;<a href="/data-vendors" data-link="webview-data-vendors" data-link-target="dynamic">Advertising Vendors and Analytics Vendors</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href="#us-data-coll-tech-current">Section 2</a>&nbsp;for more information) may also collect location information through the Services.

Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies. Some cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">"All About Cookies" guide - https://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. The cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways:</p><p>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies<br>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features.</p><p>Category 2: Performance Cookies<br>These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages). In general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. However, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.</p><p>Category 3: Functionality Cookies<br>These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news). These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services.</p><p>Category 4: Targeting Cookies<br>These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.</p><p>Category 5: Social Network Cookies<br>These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments.</p></li><li><strong>Web beacons:</strong> Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.</li><li><strong>Web Storage:</strong> We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.</li></ol></li><li class="upper-alpha"><p><em>Use of Advertising Identifiers</em></p><p>We and our&nbsp;<a href="/data-vendors" data-link="webview-data-vendors" data-link-target="dynamic">Advertising Vendors</a>&nbsp;may collect information about usage of the mobile apps via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising.

Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If you allow collection on the Sites when accessing via your mobile web browser, your location may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or if your browser blocks the collection by default, then only your general location information is collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you searched (i.e., “contextual location”).</li><li><strong>Apps Use of Location Information</strong>&nbsp;- If you access the Services on your mobile device or automotive infotainment system and consent to sharing location information with our App, we may collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via GPS, cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter or information about the vehicle. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow any of our mobile or in-vehicle Apps to directly collect location information while the App is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your settings or by deleting the App. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive select alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for the Apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services, (last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.</li><li><strong>Data Vendor Use of Location Information</strong>&nbsp;- Our service providers, and&nbsp;<a href="/data-vendors" data-link="webview-data-vendors" data-link-target="dynamic">Advertising Vendors and Analytics Vendors</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href="#us-data-coll-tech-previous">Section 2</a>&nbsp;for more information) may also collect location information through the Services.
