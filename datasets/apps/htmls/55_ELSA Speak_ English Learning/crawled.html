<h3><strong>3. Data Storage and Transfer</strong></h3>



<p>We and our authorized service providers (further detailed below) maintain, store and process personal data in the United States of America, Europe, Japan, India, Vietnam, Singapore as well as other locations, as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services in the locations where ELSA resides, or as may be required by law.</p>



<p>While privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, ELSA is committed to protecting personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice and customary industry standards, including using appropriate lawful transfer mechanisms and contractual terms requiring adequate data protection, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in the jurisdiction to which such data is transferred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For data transfers to countries that have been recognized to be providing an adequate level of data protection by the relevant supervisory authority, we rely on such adequacy findings regarding the level of data protection offered by the recipient country. For data transfers from the EEA/Switzerland/UK to countries that are not considered to be offering an adequate level of data protection, we have entered into updated Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the relevant supervisory authority.</p>



<p>In all cross-border transfers, ELSA has taken into consideration the data protection capabilities of the receiving party and the data protection regulations in the receiving country and has imposed materially similar protections and limitations on the receiving party as required and applicable to the personal data in its origin country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ELSA currently uses AWS’s cloud storage service in Ireland, the US, Japan and Singapore to store personal data.</p>

<h3><strong>5. How We Share or Otherwise Disclose Your Personal Data</strong></h3>



<p>We disclose personal data in the following ways:</p>

Depending on the applicable law, you may consent to such sharing via the registration form or by allowing your attendee badge to be scanned at a specific sponsor’s booth. In these circumstances, your personal data will be subject to the sponsors’ privacy statements. If you do not wish for your personal data to be shared, you may choose not to opt-in via the event/webinar registration or you can opt-out in accordance with Section <em>‎</em>7 below.</p>

<p><em>Legal Compliance</em>: We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your personal data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that: (a) we are legally compelled to do so; (b) disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (c) such disclosure is required to protect our legitimate business interests, including the security or integrity of our products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Protecting Rights and Safety</em>: We may share personal data with others if we believe in good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of ELSA and our employees, any of our Prospects, our Institutional Clients, any user of our Services, or any member of the general public.</p>



<p><em>Research:</em> We may also share limited pseudonymized personal data with approved not-for-profit researchers, for statistical research purposes. We require our approved researchers to adopt appropriate and relevant security measures to secure your personal data, no less onerous than those we undertake ourselves for the type of personal data processed. We will collect specific consent and/or provide you with the option of restricting this processing/ opting out of this processing, in accordance with applicable privacy laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>ELSA Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies</em>: We may share personal data internally within our group, for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

We may disclose personal data to a third-party during negotiation of, in connection with or as an asset in such a corporate business transaction. Personal data may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the avoidance of doubt, ELSA may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous.

<h3><strong>6. Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies</strong></h3>

Please bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent you from using the Services.</p>



<p>Please note that if you enter the Platforms from a new device, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), re-download the app-based platform or alter your mobile device cookie setting, you may also cause a re-set to any cookie related privacy preferences you had previously set.</p>



<p>For the purposes of the CCPA and other US State privacy laws, as applicable, in the last 12 months, we have “sold” or “shared” Internet or other electronic network activity information, Geolocation Data, and Commercial Information or used your personal information for targeted advertising, as applicable and as each is defined under applicable US State privacy laws.

<p>We have implemented industry-standard physical, administrative and technical security measures, designed to secure your personal data, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. However, we cannot guarantee that our Services will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.

<h3><strong>8. Your Data Subject Rights</strong></h3>



<p>Under certain laws, including the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), individuals have rights regarding their personal data. These rights include – each to the extent applicable to you – the right to request information concerning or request access to your personal data, or to request its correction, portability or erasure. You may also have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your personal data, the right to direct us not to sell or share your personal data to third parties now or in the future, the right to be excluded from targeted advertising, or the right to equal services and prices (e.g. freedom from discrimination). Under some regulatory frameworks you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.<br><br>To the extent applicable to you, you may designate an authorized agent, in writing or through a power of attorney, to request to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf.&nbsp; The authorized agent may submit a request to exercise these rights by emailing us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please note that when you or an authorized agent ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us with certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data regarding which you request to exercise your rights. Such additional data may be then retained by us for legal, compliance and auditing purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request or proof of request fulfillment). We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information that enables us to reasonably verify that you are the individual about whom we collected the personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each right may be executed to the extent available to you under the laws that apply to you and is subject to various exclusions and exceptions under applicable laws. Please contact us by e-mail at: <a href="mailto:privacy@elsanow.io">privacy@elsanow.io</a> if you wish to exercise your privacy rights. We may redact from the data that we will make available to you any personal data related to others. If you request deletion of your personal data, we may deny your request or may retain certain elements of your personal data if it is necessary for us or our service providers. We will provide details of our reasoning to you in our correspondence on the matter.</p>



<p>We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable privacy request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in such circumstances.</p>



<p>If you are an Institutional User / would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data that we process on behalf of our Institutional Clients, please contact the respective client (see Section 10 below for further information). Note that if you do contact us in this regard, we may share your communications with the relevant Institutional Client; under certain circumstances we may also share the contact details of the relevant Institutional Client with the individual who sent us such a request or query.</p>



<h3><strong>9. Roles and Responsibilities&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, and CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “data controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below we explain how these roles apply to our personal data processing activities, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply. ELSA is the “data controller” of Customers’, Prospects’, and Partners’ personal data as described in this Notice. In such instances, our service providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When providing our Platforms to Institutional Users, our Institutional Clients are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Platforms’ capabilities, and for ensuring that any Institutional User’s personal data provided to us meets any and all applicable privacy regulations for its collection, its ensuing usage, and its specific processing by ELSA for said usages. Specifically at the point of collection this includes the Institutional Client’s responsibility to provide appropriate notice to the Institutional User and establish legal basis as required by applicable legislation for the collection and further processing of the personal data collected.&nbsp;</p>
