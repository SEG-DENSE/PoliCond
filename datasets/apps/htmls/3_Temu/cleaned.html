We also restrict the processing if you have objected to processing pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours.</p><h3><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong></h3><p>The right to request that we provide the Personal Data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Also, you have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us.

See section below on ‘Opt-out from Marketing Communications’ for further information.</p><h3><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong></h3><p>The right to withdraw your consent at any time, where processing is based on your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p><h3><strong>Right to object to/opt-out of automated decision making</strong></h3><p>The right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated processing (i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services), or to opt out of the processing of your Personal Data for such purposes. Temu does not make decisions based solely on automated processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.</p><h3><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</strong></h3><p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, the right to lodge a complaint with our lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission or your local supervisory authority, if you consider that the processing of Personal Data relating to you infringes the GDPR.</p><p>These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to erase information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in both the GDPR/UK GDPR and in relevant local implementing legislation.</p><p>You may exercise any of these rights by submitting a request via our <a href="/bgp-additional-privacy-options.html" target="_blank">web form</a> dedicated to data subject requests or by contacting us using the information provided below. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to collect information from you to verify your identity, before providing a substantive response to the request.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, or anonymise it.</p><p>Data of Temu users located in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland will be stored by default in the infrastructure of cloud service providers in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Personal information (such as account and profile information) unrelated to fulfilment services will not be transferred. At the same time, in all cases, we will ensure that all transfers of personal data comply with applicable legal requirements.</p><h2 id="change_privacy">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2><p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy.
