				<!-- <p>Hi friend, </p> 
				
				<p>Happy to see that you care for your privacy just like we do!</p> -->
				
				<p>We are happy to see that you care for your privacy just like we do. On this page we will go over our privacy policy. 
					For the international online community that we are, privacy rules are a challenge, since there are no global agreements on this. 
					Pick Up Limes (PUL) is registered in The Netherlands (a very small but lovely country within the EU Region) and we will, therefore, abide by the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_nl">GDPR</a>. 
					Luckily the GDPR is as strict as any other privacy regulation, so your data is safe with us.</p>
				
				<p>In this policy, we will explain what personal data do we collect, why, for how long and on what legal grounds, and how we secure your privacy to the extent of our abilities. 
					Realize that if you follow us on social media such as Instagram or YouTube, they have their own policy on Data Protection that is beyond our reach. 
					Our love for food includes cookies as well and in this policy, we will explain how we use the digital ones. 
					Let’s start with the official privacy policy.
					</p>

					<h2 style="padding-top: 0;">Community members</h2>
					<p>
						The Pick Up Limes community consists of loads of people all around the world joining in to relish in a nourishing lifestyle. When you join our community by 
						<a target="_blank" href="/newsletter">signing up for the newsletter</a>, we ask your name, your email address, and we get to see your country.
						We might receive additional data that you send us voluntarily in a message through email, or contact form or on our socials. 
						We don’t officially keep track of this data and we strongly advise you not to send personal medical information to us. 
						We collect your data to welcome you as a PUL community member, and to send you occasional exclusive recipes and information on plant-based living. 
						We do so because you asked us to do this when you signed up for the newsletter. 
						The legal basis is permission, and you can step out of the community at any time by using the signing off link in our emails. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We love receiving your emails, and most of the time we delete it directly after reading it. 
						Sometimes we keep it for a few months to give us some time to respond or to memorize any ideas, requests, or recipes that you ask us to add to the community.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any response that you give on our social media channels will remain posted until you delete it yourself, or the channel decides to archive or delete your messages. 
						When we decide that a response is compromising in any way, we are free to delete that response. For more information, see our <a target="_blank" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Users</h2>
					<p>
						Those using the Pick Up Limes mobile app (App), are referred to as users. Using the App requires you to make an account. We need this feature to serve you personalised recommendations, allow you to store your favourite recipes, and to make and store personal meal plans. Your account is related to at least one email address, which we may use to communicate with you directly about important notices, such as updates to this privacy policy.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three ways to make an account; by using your Google account, by using your Apple ID, or by using a one-time email link. When you use your Google account, or when you sign in using a one-time email link, your email address gets registered in our authentication service. When you sign up with your Apple ID, you can shield your associated email if you so choose, in which case we receive a proxy email that cannot be traced back to your Apple account. In addition, if you sign in with Google, we will also receive your Google username for personalisation purposes. Our authentication service is hosted in the cloud, and our data is kept on the east coast of the United States. Note that we do not store any password data and our staff works  on a strictly need-to-know basis and have received proper training to deal with your personal data.
					</p>

					<h2>Biometrics</h2>
					<p>To provide personalized nutrition information in the App, you can optionally provide biometric information, i.e., your physical activity level, age, height, weight, biological sex, and, if applicable, your pregnancy status and due date. We use this information to estimate your nutritional needs. We safely store this information only locally on your mobile device by encrypting it, making it accessible only to you. We do not collect or share this information, and none of our team members has access to this information. By design, your biometric information is kept as private as we are technically capable of doing. Consequently, if you switch devices, or if you delete and reinstall the app, your biometric data is not carried over and will have to be re-entered.</p>
					
					<h2>Payments and Stripe</h2>
					<p>
						When you purchase a gift card or a subscription to the App through our website, payments are processed securely by our third-party payment processor, Stripe. 
						We do not store any of your payment information on our servers. 
						Stripe handles all payment transactions, and your payment details are encrypted and transmitted directly to Stripe. 
						Stripe's use of your personal information is governed by their own <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/en-nl/legal/privacy-center">privacy policy</a>, which we recommend you review. 
						We only receive a confirmation from Stripe that the payment was successful, along with limited information necessary to associate the payment with your user account.	
					</p>

					<h2>User Content</h2>
					<p>In using the App, you can generate User Content if you choose. We use these features so you can plan and track your nutrition intake, so you have a convenient place to store your recipes, and so you can engage with other users about plant-based cooking. Specifically, the following User Content can be generated.</p>
					
					<h3>Comments and replies</h3>
					<p>These are messages you post on a discussion thread related to a recipe. These posts are stored on our content database and are visible to other users of the App, and to visitors on the Website if the related recipe is public. The email address related to your user account (App) or the one you provide (Website), is associated which each comment and reply you post so that we can communicate with you about any updates related to you posts. We retain this data on our content server for as long as the recipe content is deemed relevant by us for public display. </p>

					<h3>My recipes</h3>
					<p>These are recipes you input into the App. These recipes are not shared with other users. Key benefits of inputting your recipes into the App are that the App; will calculate the nutritional content of the recipes, enable you to include your personal recipes in your meal plans, and enable you to subsequently generate grocery lists based on the constituent ingredients. You can delete these recipes at any time, and we will retain them in storage for as long as you are an active user, and up to 18 months after you've stopped being an active user.</p>
					
					<h3>My items</h3>
					<p>These are food items you input in the App with the purpose to track your daily consumption and/or to make personalized meal plans, and subsequently generating grocery lists. This feature serves to extend the food options beyond what is offered by the food item database in the Service. You can delete these items at any time, and we will retain them in storage for as long as you are an active user, and up to 18 months after you've stopped being an active user.</p>

					<h3>Nourish plans</h3>
					<p>These are detailed daily meal plans that you generate using the App. You can include PUL recipes, food items, personal recipes, and personal items. The App also provides personalized plans to fit your nutritional needs. You can delete these plans at any time, and we will retain them in storage for a period of up to 18 months.</p>

					<h3>Favorite recipes</h3>
					<p>This is a collection of PUL recipes that you compose for quick access throughout the App. You can remove recipes from this list at any time. We retain this list on our cloud storage for as long as you are an active user.</p>

					<h3>Recently viewed recipes</h3>
					<p>This is a list of PUL recipes that you have recently viewed. This list is only stored locally on your device. This data is removed when you delete the app and its data.</p>

					<h3>Custom groceries</h3>
					<p>These grocery items are manually added by You. These are stored on only locally on your device and are not shared with anyone. Consequently, if you switch devices, or if you delete and reinstall the app, your custom groceries will not carry over and will have to be re-entered. You can remove these inputs at any time, and they are removed when you delete the app and its data.</p>

					<h2>Affiliate links</h2>
					<p>
						In our <a href="/shop/">shop</a>, we show the goods we use at PUL, or products we believe in. The links in the shop redirect you to PUL partners that are resellers of these products. When you click on the affiliate link in our shop and buy a product, the resellers give us a small commission for the recommendation. As a PUL community member, you financially support the PUL community with your new acquisition. The PUL partner gets data from you as you sign up on their website. Through cookies, the PUL website gives the necessary information to the PUL partner that a member/visitor of PUL used an affiliate link.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you buy a PUL product, such as an E-book, a subscription to the App, or possibly in the future: E-courses, you become a PUL customer. The legal basis then turns from permission to contractual agreement. From our customers, we also collect bank account numbers, delivery details, and we keep track of your purchases. We need this to deliver your purchases. We will keep this information for our own administration which we are legally required to hold on to it for at least 8 years after purchase.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may also use customer information for our legitimate interests. This means that we want to provide our customers and members the most optimal and personalized service possible by using marketing techniques.
					</p>

					<h2>Team members</h2>
					<p>
						We have a wonderful <a target="_blank" href="/about#team">PUL team</a> consisting of employees and freelancers. 
						From team members, we collect as much data as obliged for our (employee-) administration and our legal and tax duties as an employer or client according to Dutch Law. 
						This data consists of names, addresses, company info, contact info, social security numbers, social media account names and photos, bank account numbers, and pictures, audio, 
						or any other footage or data we receive or make during the assignments. We collect this data so you can join the PUL team, help us to enrich the community, 
						and so that we can reward you for it. The legal basis for this is called a contractual agreement. We will keep your personal/business files for at least two years after you stopped being a PUL team member. 
						The data that we need for our own tax administration will be kept for at least 8 years. The data and footage that is published within the PUL community or online will remain there for as long as the community lives. 
						If you send us your resume to become a PUL team member, we will correspond with you on how long you want us to keep your data in our minds and files. 
						If you do not consent or ask us to keep your data, we will delete your mail and resume promptly after reading it.
					</p>
					<h2>Partners</h2>
					<p>
						We have a nice range of PUL partners consisting of affiliate link parties, sponsors, and collaborators. From PUL partners we collect as much data as obliged for our administration and our legal and tax duties according to Dutch Law. This data consists of names, addresses, company info, contact info, social media account names and photos, bank account numbers, pictures, audio, or any other footage or data we receive or make during the assignments. We collect this data so you can help us expand, enrich, and make the PUL community livelier. Legally this is called a contractual agreement. We will keep your business files for at least two years after you stopped being a PUL Partner. The data that we need for our own tax administration will be kept for at least 8 years. The data and footage that is published within the PUL community or online will remain for as long as the community lives.
