<strong>5. Where Do We Store Your Personal Information? How Do We

</p>
<p>
            Data collected by us is stored in the United States. Polyverse
            provides the Services worldwide, so your Personal Information may be
            processed outside your country or jurisdiction. Some countries that

            by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data
            protection according to EEA standards. For transfers from the EEA to
            countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we
            take appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal
            Information remain protected in accordance with applicable law.

<p>
<strong>6. How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information?
            </strong>
</p>
<p>
            We retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted
            for the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with
            applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods
            include:
          </p>
<p>
            • The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and
            provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an
            account with us or continue to use the Services);
          </p>
<p>
            • Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for

            transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete
            them);
          </p>
<p>
            • Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (for
            example, in light of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation
            or regulatory investigations).
          </p>

<p>
<strong>7. How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</strong>
</p>
<p>

            have access to Personal Information with which the relevant data
            processing agreements are signed. We also guide and train our
            personnel to process your data securely according to our internal
