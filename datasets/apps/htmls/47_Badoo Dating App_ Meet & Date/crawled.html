<h1>Badoo Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Badoo Privacy Policy (“Policy”)! This explains how we collect, store, protect and share your information, and with whom we share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction with our <a href="terms" target="">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re enjoying the Badoo mobile application (including the desktop version) (“App”), our websites and microsites (such as Badoo.com) or using our digital products and services (such as our competitions or surveys) (together, referred to in this Privacy Policy as our “Sites”), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App or Sites to share information with other Badoo members including your friends and contacts (“Users”). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>
<p>Badoo’s App and Sites are global, and your information will be sent to and used in the United States and the UK regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully!</p>
<h2>Who we are</h2> 
<p>Badoo Trading Limited acts as the data controller of the personal information collected and processed through the Badoo App and Sites (referred to in this Policy as “we” and “us”). </p>
<p>Badoo has designated a Data Protection Officer that can be reached by emailing DPO@badoo.com or by post at the following address: 1 Blossom Yard, Fourth Floor, London E1 6RS</p>
<h2>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Registration information</h3> 
<p>When you download the App and create an account (“Account”), we may collect certain information (“Registration Information”) about you, such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Name;</li> 
<li>Username;</li> 
<li>Email address</li> 
<li>Mobile number</li> 
<li>Gender identity;</li> 
<li>Date of birth;</li> 
<li>Sexual preference;</li> 
<li>Photographs;</li> 
<li>Location, and</li> 
<li>Login information for social media accounts that you connect to your Badoo Account (this could include, for example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts). For more information about this, see “Linking other accounts to Badoo” in section 7 below.</li> </ul>
<p>You will also be required to create a password in connection with the registration of your Account. Once you register, you will be able to review and change this information at any time just by logging in to Badoo (other than your location, which, if you have given Badoo access to your location in your device settings, is automatically updated based on the location of your device) or contacting Badoo’s <a href="feedback" target="">Customer Support Team</a>. It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update this in your account.</p>
<p>The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users (robots are not welcome!). Registration Information such as your sexual preference, name and username may be visible to other Users who view your profile page.</p>
<p>For users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls within the following categories of “personal information,” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A. Identifiers, such as name and location;</li> 
<li>B. Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;</li> 
<li>C. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;</li> 
<li>D. Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;</li> <li>E. Biometric information, such as faceprint;</li> 
<li>F. Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our Sites and App;</li>
<li>G. Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;</li> 
<li>H. Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;</li> <li>I. Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;</li> 
<li>J. Non-public education information; and</li> 
<li>K. Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and characteristics.</li> </ul>
<h3>Profile Information</h3> 
<p>We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.</p>
<p>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Badoo.</p>
<h3>Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)</h3> 
<p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we may require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you carry out <a href="https://badoo.com/help/?section=265#settings-help-question/271/3441" target="_blank">photo verification<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a>. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Badoo accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Badoo network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue “verified” badge to your profile).</p>
<p>If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. We’ll keep your photo to compare it with any future photos you add to your profile. Your verification photo will not be visible on your profile.</p>
<h3>Purchases Information</h3> 
<p>If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.</p>
<p>Badoo uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour that indicates breaches of our <a href="terms" target="">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can contact Badoo to contest the decision.</p>
<p>Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any account(s) that you have on any other Badoo Group platforms/applications, such as Bumble, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures. </p>
<h3>Geolocation Information</h3> 
<p>If you have given Badoo access to your location in your device settings, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we may use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the profiles of other Users who are near you.</p>
<p>If you have given Badoo access to your location services, but wish to turn them off, you can do so by the following methods:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Badoo</li> 
<li>Android — settings, location, Badoo, permissions, location</li> 
</ol>
<h3>Device Information</h3> 
<p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, and operating system, for a number of purposes, as set out here. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.</p>
<h3>Links</h3> 
<p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Badoo, including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<h3>Honesty Club and other Contributions</h3> 
<p>From time to time, we run surveys for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to provide feedback, a testimonial or take part in marketing campaigns (for example, if you let us know that you have found a match on the App, we may contact you to ask if you would be happy to feature in advertising for Badoo). Such surveys and marketing campaigns are optional and more information will be provided at the point of contact. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact our Customer Support Team via our <a href="feedback" target="">Feedback Page</a>.</p>
<h3>When you contact Customer Support</h3> <p>If you contact our Customer Support team via <a href="feedback" target="">Feedback page</a>, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other users (and from other users about you) for 6 years after deletion of your account.</p>
<h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3> 
<p>When you visit our Sites or when you use our App, we may collect personal data from you automatically by using cookies or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device or browser that allows us to recognise and remember you. If you would like to find out more about cookies, including how we use them and what choices are available to you, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h2>2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Our main goal is to ensure your experience on Badoo is an enjoyable one and in order to deliver it to you, we may use your Registration and other information to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>offer you our services and features;</li> 
<li>contact you with information about the App (e.g. updates and new features);</li> 
<li>to personalise the App/Sites and the content we deliver to you;</li> 
<li>conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with the App/Sites;</li> 
<li>test new technologies and processes designed to enhance and develop the App/Sites;</li> <li>resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our <a href="terms" target="">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>;</li> 
<li>investigate fraud, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our <a href="terms" target="">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>;</li> 
<li>to send you information about the promotions and offers we have available (e.g., specify the types of goods/services/offers to be provided via direct marketing) by direct marketing or other modes of communication - if you’ve signed up for our communications or otherwise told us it’s ok. We will not use your information in email direct marketing unless you give us your consent during the Account creating process or via Settings in the App (you can withdraw from marketing at any time via Settings in the App or by using the opt-out mechanisms and links provided in each message); and</li> 
<li>protect our Users and third parties from harm.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Our Matching Algorithms</h3> <p>Our mission is to create kind and equitable relationships. We have developed matching algorithms to predict your compatibility with other users so we can show you people we think are a good match for you. We use different indications based on users’ profiles on our app (for example, how you swipe or whether you match with someone). We use these indications to recommend the most relevant profiles to everyone to maximise everyone’s chances of finding meaningful connections on our apps. Our matching algorithms are based on a range of factors and use machine learning to rank profiles for you to maximise your chance of finding compatible matches. We use the following data about you and other users to predict your compatibility with others and generate profile recommendations: <b>the information you provide us about yourself</b> in your profile such as age, distance or gender so we can show you people who are appropriate and are more likely to like you back; <b>information about how you interact with our app</b> to suggest to you people who are active and available to meet new people; <b>and your device coordinates</b>, which are necessary to understand your proximity to other members. The legal basis for processing profile and proximity information is that this is necessary for the provision of our contractual services to you pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Where we process information about your app activity, this is based on our legitimate interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and specifically our legitimate interest in generating more personalised and relevant recommendations for who you can match with in our App. Where you have included sensitive information in your profile, such as information about your beliefs, the processing of this information is based on your voluntary and explicit consent.</p>
<h3>Moderation Practices</h3> 
<p>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for content that indicates breaches of our <span>Terms and Conditions of Use</span>. If an account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the <a href="terms" target="">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will be subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Badoo to contest the decision.</p> 
<p><b>If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to your Account.</b></p>
<h3>Lawful Basis</h3>
<p>Under EU and UK data protection laws, we are required to tell you our lawful basis for using your data and we have set this out in the table below. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any time. Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to our use of your data. We explain in the relevant sections in this Policy how you can withdraw consent or opt-out of certain data uses (where applicable).</p>

<h2>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURES</h2>
<h3>Service Providers</h3> 
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which Badoo shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our Apps and Sites a User engages with. For example, to provide our services to Badoo App Users, we typically use the following suppliers:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Billing services - to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example, Google Play)</li> 
<li>Authentication services - to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example, Twilio)</li> 
<li>Social media providers - to allow customers to create/connect their Badoo account with their account(s) on such platforms (for example Facebook or Instagram)</li> 
<li>Product improvement and market research - we use third party platforms (such as Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services</li> 
<li>Growth marketing services - to allow us to market and advertise Badoo to potential customers (for example AppsFlyer and Facebook)</li> 
<li>IT services - some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process customers’ personal data (for example, if a customer contacts us via social media with a support inquiry, their inquiry is processed by our community management software provider Khoros)</li> </ul>
<p>We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.</p>
<h3>Marketing Service Providers and Advertising Partners</h3> 
<p>We may partner with advertising publishers to place third party adverts on our App and Sites (‘Advertising Partners’). We also partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (‘Marketing Services Providers’) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Badoo account;</li> 
<li>to show Badoo adverts to users who have visited the Badoo App/Sites but haven’t yet created a Badoo account;</li> 
<li>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers hold about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience); or</li> 
<li>to include you in a ‘custom audience’ that will receive Badoo advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).</li> 
</ul>
<p>We share a limited amount of your personal data with companies that help us with marketing and advertising, such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer), know when an ad has been viewed or clicked on in the App or sites, and when an ad causes a “conversion” (for example downloading the app advertised to you))</li> 
<li>your estimated location (based on your IP address)</li> 
<li>age and gender</li> 
<li>data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you download our App or created an Account with our App)</li> 
<li>a hashed* version of your email address (to create ‘custom audiences’).</li>
<p>*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random numbers and letters - this code cannot be traced back to the email address. When hashed email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they’re then matched against the Provider’s own existing list of their own users’ hashed information and our ads are served to those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Provider’s. Matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.</p>
</ul>
<p>For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our <a href="https://badoo.com/en-us/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.</p>
<h3>Facebook</h3> 
<p>Where we share data with Facebook as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Facebook “Like” function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Facebook Ireland for this processing. This arrangement means that Badoo has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Facebook if you wish to exercise your data protection rights. Further information, including how Facebook enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as an independent data controller can be found in <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">Facebook Ireland’s Data Policy<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a>. If you want more information relating to the nature of the arrangement we have in place with Facebook, please email DPO@badoo.com.</p>
<p>This data referred to above can include actions that you take on our website such as your interactions with our website or other information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you and people like you (including on social media such as Facebook).</p>
<h3>Google’s reCAPTCHA service</h3> 
<p>To protect the input and comment areas of our App against spam and abuse, we use the reCAPTCHA verification tool. This service is provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA and is subject to Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">terms of service<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a>.</p>
<p>reCAPTCHA makes it possible to differentiate between inputs of human origin and those that are carried out improperly by a bot. Certain device and application data will be transmitted to Google’s servers in order to determine whether actions on our App really come from humans. Google may also use this data to improve the reCAPTCHA service. This data may include: URLs; user IP address; Google account information if the user is logged in to their Google account at the same time; browser information, including browser type, browser size, browser resolution, browser plug-ins, language settings and date; mouse and touch events within the page; and information collected from cookies. This processing is based on our predominant legitimate interests in protecting our App from abusive bots.</p>
<h2>4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU</h2>
<p>We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.</p>
<p>When using the Badoo App, you should assume that <b>anything</b> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.</p>
<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Badoo may reveal information about yourself as well. <b>Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.</b></p>
<p>Your Badoo profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Facebook or Instagram – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be Users of the App. For example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.</p>
<p>Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only) Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Badoo has no control over how Users may then publish or use that information.</p>
<p>If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from accessing your Badoo account.</p>
<h2>5. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.</h2>
<p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use Badoo.</p>
<p>Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.</p>
<h2>6. SECURITY.</h2>
<p>Badoo has implemented appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure and alteration of the information under our control, including your personal data. We use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Our technical experts at Badoo work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!</li> 
<li>Please don’t share the password you use to access your Badoo Account with anyone else!</li> 
<li>Change your password periodically.</li> 
</ol>
<p>If you ever think someone has had access to your password or Account, please follow the steps set out here. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<h2>7. LINKING OTHER ACCOUNTS TO BADOO.</h2>
<h3>Using your social media details to sign in to Badoo</h3> 
<p>When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to Facebook to share with us your name and profile picture. Unless you opt-out, you also give permission to Facebook to share with us your email address (if there is one associated with your Facebook account), date of birth, profile photos, gender, Page likes and current town/city.</p>
<p>If you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your Apple login, a name (that can be edited by you) and an email (you can choose to hide your email and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private). This email address will be linked to your Badoo account and will be used to retrieve your Badoo account.</p>
<p>We will then use this personal data to form your Badoo account. If you remove the Badoo app from your Facebook settings, or from your Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this data. However, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up your Badoo account using your Facebook or Apple ID (you must delete your Badoo account entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).</p>
<h3>Linking social media accounts to your Badoo account</h3> 
<p>You may link your Badoo account with your Instagram or Facebook accounts. This allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your Badoo account (for example, Instagram photos).</p>
<p>We only receive the limited information that Instagram/Facebook permits to be transferred (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook and agreed by you when you first connect your account from such platforms with your Badoo account).</p>
<p>If you no longer want to link your Badoo account to your Instagram or Facebook account, please visit the settings in your Instagram or Facebook account and follow the instructions to remove the Badoo app access permissions. Please note that any information already added to your Badoo account from those platforms will not be deleted unless you delete it within your Badoo account as well.</p>
<h2>8. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 9 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you and explain how we have collected, used and shared your personal information over the past 12 months.</li> 
<li>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</li> 
</ol>
<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to us at <a href="mailto:DPO@badoo.com" target="">DPO@badoo.com</a>.</p>
<p>From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we may, if you participate in such a promotion, disclose your contact information to the third party to allow them to market their products or services to you. Where this is a condition for participation in a promotion, we will always let you know before you enter the promotion. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.</p>
<p>In addition, Under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across third-party online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator’s service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User’s online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.</p>
<h2>9. YOUR RIGHTS.</h2>

<h2>10. DATA LOCATIONS.</h2>
<p>We want you to be able to access Badoo wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK, EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia. The hardware is located in third-party data centres but is owned by the Badoo Group. Data collected by Advertising Partners and other Service Providers may also be held outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such as: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">EU approved model clauses<span class="csms-a11y-visually-hidden"> (opens in new window)</span></a>, and implementing robust contractual standards. If you want more information relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place, please email DPO@badoo.com.</p>
<h2>11. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION.</h2>
<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to learn about our retention policy with respect to biometric information.</p>
<p>When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up to 28 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:</p>
<ol> 
<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may need to be kept for tax and accounting purposes);</li> 
<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information and a record of the behaviour that led to the block - this information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims concerning the block);</li> 
<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li> 
<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security (for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account).</li> 
</ol>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>
