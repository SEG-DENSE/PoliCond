Headspace may deliver coaching services, psychotherapy services (i.e. therapy), and psychiatry services (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>”) using the Products or via other delivery methods, as applicable. Headspace provides the Services through its affiliated medical providers and partners, including Ginger.io of California Medical P.C. (“<strong>Ginger Medical</strong>”) or third party medical providers (Ginger Medical and these third party medical providers will be collectively referred to as our “<strong>Care Providers</strong>”). Throughout this Privacy Policy, we will collectively refer to all of our Products and Services as our “<strong>Platform</strong>.” This Privacy Policy covers the “<strong>personal information</strong>,” meaning information about an identified or identifiable individual that is collected through our Product or Services.</p><p>Depending on how you interact with us, the following may also apply to you:</p><ul><li>Our Services are delivered by our Care Providers.

Similarly, you may have been given access to our Product or Services in a manner that includes additional terms or privacy notices such as from your employer. The language of those terms and privacy notices supplement this Privacy Policy unless there is a conflict, in which case those additional terms and privacy notices will apply.</li><li>You may follow links contained in our Platform or provided to you by other users to third-party websites or products not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or products. We strongly suggest you review their privacy policies to understand how your personal information is used and stored by those third parties.</li><li>Similar to the above point, you may use single sign-on (SSO) features to access our Platform, such as through your social media accounts or through your employer. That use may be subject to your SSO provider’s terms and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them prior to using those features.</li><li>This privacy policy does not apply to Headspace employees or applicants to Headspace. Applicants can learn about how we use their personal information by reading our <a data-testid="link" href="https://www.headspace.com/applicant-notice" rel="" target="_self">Applicant Privacy Notice here</a>, and employees will be provided further details as part of onboarding.</li></ul><p>Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information.
