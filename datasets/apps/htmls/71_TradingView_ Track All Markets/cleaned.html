<h2 class="tv-privacy-policy__title">Public information on our site</h2>
<h3 class="tv-privacy-policy__subtitle">Public Profile</h3>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">When you create your profile on our Service, other users or visitors may access your public profile and see any information you have made available about yourself. When browsing for trading ideas, they will only be able to view your market information (i.e. published ideas and scripts, markets allocation, top mentioned Symbols, etc.), social information (i.e. followers and following lists along with the ideas that you follow and comment on), contact information (i.e. your About section, avatar, links to your social media accounts, website, etc.), your community status (i.e. Moderator or Pro badges, statistical information such as reputation points, views, likes, followers, registration date, as well your last visit date). Your email address, however, will not be visible (unless you choose to make it visible).</p>
<h3 class="tv-privacy-policy__subtitle">Public content</h3>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">
		Our Service allows those with a registered user account to share their charts with indicators and comments, their ideas, scripts, and other content with the rest of the internet via our publish features.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">
		By using public publishing features, you grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty-free license to publish and disclose the content, as well as the username of the author, which makes you identifiable.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">
		You can also publish your content as "private". This means that it will not be displayed in your profile or your lists of ideas, scripts, etc., nor will it be indexed by search engines. However, users who have a direct link to your content will be able to view it. Note that you will control over who/which users have access to a link.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">
		When you comment on any content, we also publish certain information about your comment: including date, time and application (such as "TradingView for iOS" if you commented on it from one of our applications).</p>
<h3 class="tv-privacy-policy__subtitle">Chats and Private Messages</h3>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__subtext">When you communicate with other users in public and private chats, we store and process your messages and any related information. We check links to make sure there is no malicious software or content as well as to detect spam and prohibited images/text. When you use private messages to communicate, please keep in mind that the recipients have a copy of your correspondence as well. This will continue to be the case even if you delete such correspondence from your account. Recipients can copy, store and/or reshare these messages. Be constantly vigilant of this.</p>
<h2 class="tv-privacy-policy__title">Security of personal data</h2>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">We use technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal data and require third parties with whom we work to do the same.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit to us. This technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone while it is being transmitted to TradingView or payment processor. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the "lock" icon in the browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure and encrypted connection has been established with the Website. We work hard to ensure that our Service is secure and that we meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards, such as firewalls, authentication systems (i.e. passwords, and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data. If you have chosen to create an account, you are responsible for doing everything you reasonably can to keep your access details secret. You must not share these details with anyone else.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users' personal information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are allowed to access it.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">The servers that store personal data are located in a secure environment in a locked facility.</p>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">We are constantly improving the ways we secure, store, and process the data we collect, including the addition of physical security measures that help us counter unauthorized access to our systems. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h2 class="tv-privacy-policy__title">Children and sensitive personal data</h2>
<p class="tv-privacy-policy__privacy-policy-text">
				This Website is not directed towards children who are under the age of 18.
