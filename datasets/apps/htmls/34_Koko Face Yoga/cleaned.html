<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</h2><div class="rich-text__text rte scroll-trigger animate--slide-in" data-cascade="" style="--animation-order: 2;">
<p></p><p>Privacy Policy</p><p>Updated: May 17, 2024</p><p>This Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share, and protect information in relation to our mobile services, website, and any software provided on or in connection with Koko Face Yoga’s services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p><p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to process your content.</p><p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p><p>1. <strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p><p>When you interact with us through Koko Face Yoga’s website or App (collectively “Service”), we collect the information you provide, usage information including facial biometrics, and information about your device. We also may collect information about you from other sources like service providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:</p><p>a) Personal Information:</p><p>"Personal Information" includes data that identifies, relates to, describes, or can be directly or indirectly linked to an individual. This data is collected through various methods, such as when you register on our website/app, make a purchase, participate in surveys, or sign up for newsletters. We also receive Personal Information from third-party sources occasionally to enhance our services. Types of Personal Information we collect include:</p><ul><li>Personal Identifiers: Name, age, gender, username.</li><li>Facial Biometrics: We employ facial recognition technology, specifically focusing on innovative tongue posture detection, to enhance user experiences and advance our services. Here’s how we handle this data:</li><li>Processing and Storage of Facial Data: We process facial data in real-time during your session. To support the development and refinement of our machine learning algorithms for tongue posture detection—a pioneering feature in the industry—we retain facial images that include tongue positioning for up to one year.</li><li>Storage Location and Security: This data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers located in Sweden. AWS adheres to high standards of data security and complies with relevant data protection laws, ensuring the integrity and privacy of your data.</li><li>Storage Duration: We retain facial images, including detailed tongue posture data, for a period of one year. This extended retention period is necessary to accumulate sufficient data for developing effective machine learning models, as there are no existing comparative datasets in this new area of technology. This timeframe allows us to analyze variations and improve the accuracy of our tongue detection technology significantly.</li><li>Contact Information: Email address, phone number, home address.</li><li>Financial Information: Credit card numbers and transaction history for service purchases.</li></ul><p>b) Device Identifiable Information:</p><p>This includes information that may not directly identify you but is linked to your computer or device. We collect this data through normal interactions with our services, such as IP addresses, browser types, and device information, which help us improve service functionality and user experience.</p><p>We may collect information that may not reasonably identify you personally, but is linked to your computer or device ("Device Identifiable Information"). We collect Device Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of providing the Services. When you visit Koko Face Yoga to browse or read information, we automatically collect information about your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses. We may use Device Identifiable Information to analyze trends, help administer the Services, track the online movement of users, to learn about and determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the service, how visitors navigate throughout Koko Face Yoga or use other Services, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may also collect Device Identifiable Information through "cookies" or "web beacons" as explained below.</p><p>In addition, we may collect information about your mobile device such as the type and model, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), applications using our Websites, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising ("IDFA"), Android Advertising ID ("AAID"), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID.</p><p>We may also collect your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider ("ISP") or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.</p><p>2. <strong>HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>a) Cookies and Web Beacons</p><p>To help us serve you better, we may collect Device Identifiable Information from you through technologies such as "cookies" and "web beacons" (which are also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or pixels) or by tracking internet protocol ("IP") addresses.</p><p>"Cookies" are small data files that are stored by your web browser when you interact with a website. When you visit a webpage, the cookie sends back Device Identifiable Information.</p><p>"Web beacons" are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of the Websites and effectiveness of communication. These web beacons can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website.</p><p>Cookies operate in the background and you can turn them off by adjusting your Web browser settings, but doing so may make it difficult to use some of the features on the Websites or the features may not be available to you. We may use cookies to make your Website experience easier by, for example, remembering your preferences, keeping track of your login name, password, etc. We may also use cookies and other activity tracking tools on the Websites and through other Services to collect your engagement metrics, including your Personal Identifiers and Device Identifiable Information, related to your activity on the Websites and Services.</p><p>Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your online activities. The Websites and Services do not currently support Do Not Track requests.</p><p>b) Other Direct Interactions with You</p><p>You give us your information in your direct interactions with us. We collect information you provide to us when you sign up for accounts on our Koko Face Yoga’s Services; request information from us; respond to surveys; participate in sweepstakes or contests; or otherwise interact with us. This information includes Personal Identifiers, Facial Biometrics, Contact Information, Financial Information, and Device Identifiable Information, which you give us from time to time.</p><p>c) Social Media</p><p>When using the Koko Face Yoga’s Services or when using certain third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) (each a "Social Network"), you may have the option to connect your Service information and activity with your Social Network information and activity. If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to share or publish information about your Service activity with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you consent to the connection.</p><p>Information we may share with a Social Network may include technical information about your Service activity, your Service comments. Information we may access about you, with your consent, from a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, your basic Social Network information, your location data, your list of contacts, friends or followers and certain information about your activities on the Social Network. If you permit a connection between a Social Network and a Service, we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. For more information, please review the privacy disclosures and terms of your Social Network account, which govern how that account information is collected and shared with us.</p><p>d) Meta data</p><p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you share a photo) or other data.</p><p>3. <strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>For the Purpose Collected: If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we will use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you make an online booking purchase, we will use your credit card information to fulfill and process your purchases. Also, if you register or open an account on the Services, the Personal Information you provide may be used to maintain your account, provide you access to certain features of our Services, or offer you the benefits and privileges that typically come along with registration. These benefits may include access to and use of exclusive or personalized content or activities, participation in special events and promotions (such as contests and sweepstakes).</p><p>Support from Service Providers: In addition, Personal Information and Device Identifiable Information we collect may be used by us and by third-party service providers such as hosting providers, data management companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies (e.g., Google Analytics), distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and payment processors (collectively, "Service Providers") for a variety of purposes, including to:</p><p>Contact you about the Websites and/or Services you have requested; provide you with Services or information you have requested, or services you have ordered or signed up for, confirm or fulfill an order you have made; facilitate the operation, maintenance and improvement of the Services, our business operations, and internal record keeping; provide you with advertising that may be more relevant to you; and with your permission, send you promotional material or special offers.</p><p>Our Service Providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions in connection with the Services, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p><p>Identity Verification and Security: We obtain information about you from other businesses to verify your identity so we can properly process your requests and prevent fraud. By accessing and using our Services, you agree that we may use your submitted and obtained Personal Information and Device Identifiable Information for such purposes and to maintain the security of the Services.</p><p>Service Improvement and Marketing: We may also use your Personal Identifiers, Facial Identification, Contact Information, Financial Information, Device Identifiable Information, and other information collected through the Services to: help us improve the content and functionality of the Services; better understand our users and their preferences; provide customer support; personalize experiences and product offerings on our Services; and tailor payment plan offerings.</p><p>We may also use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services and, to the extent permitted by law, to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.</p><p>Enforcement and Legal Obligations: We may use your Personal Information to enforce our Terms of Service, or investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal, and to respond to legal proceedings and obligations.</p><p>4. <strong>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Koko Face Yoga (or the group of companies of which Koko Face Yoga is a part) without your consent, except as Parties with whom we may share your information in this Policy.</p><p>Parties with whom we may share your information:</p><p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Koko Face Yoga is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).</p><p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p><p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p><p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p><p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p><p>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</p><p>Any information or content that you voluntarily process with the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to Koko Face Yoga anonymously.</p><p>What happens in the event of a change of control:</p><p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Service or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>5. <strong>HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Storage and Processing:</p><p>We store and process your information, including personal and facial biometrics data, on servers located in Sweden and the United States, utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Sweden. These servers meet high standards of data security and comply with relevant data protection laws.</p><p>Data Transfer:</p><p>By using our Service, you consent to the transfer of your information to the U.S. and Sweden. We may transfer information across borders to ensure the operation of our Services, even to countries with different data protection laws than your own. This helps us maintain the Service's reliability and performance.</p><p>Security Measures:</p><p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect your information and take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. Please help maintain the security of your information by keeping your login credentials private and managing your privacy settings diligently.</p><p>Responsibility:</p><p>While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You play a crucial role in protecting your personal information. Manage your privacy settings carefully and be cautious about how you share information online.</p><p>6. <strong>YOUR CCPA RIGHTS AND CHOICES</strong></p><p>As a California consumer and subject to certain limitations under the CCPA, you have choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information:</p><p>Exercising the right to know:</p><p>You may request, up to twice in a 12-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:</p><ul><li>The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;</li><li>The categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;</li><li>The business or commercial purpose for which we collected the personal information;</li><li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information;</li><li>The categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose; and</li><li>The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that information for a business purpose.</li></ul><p>Exercising the right to delete:</p><p>You may request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain limitations under applicable law.</p><p>Exercising the right to opt-out from a sale:</p><p>You may request to opt out of any “sale” of your personal information that may take place.
