We may also use the advertising services and networks offered by these social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter to deliver ad content. Use of these services requires the social media platform to implement cookies and/or pixels to deliver ads to you while online with such platforms.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">If you are a member of one of these networks but do not wish the operator to collect data relating to you via our Services, you can take the following steps:</p><ul class="list-disc"><li>Always log out completely from the network in question before visiting other websites, and delete any related cookies, as the plug-in providers have represented to us that your personal details such as your IP address are only collected and processed when members are logged in to the social network;</li><li>Hide the plug-ins using an ad blocker; or</li><li>The platform may allow you to disable such interest-based advertising, which you would need to investigate with the particular platform provider. For example, you may opt out of interest-based advertising on Twitter by notifying Twitter through one of the methods they describe online: <a class="underline text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-500" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405</a></li></ul><h2 class="text-[1.5rem] font-extrabold leading-tight font-ringside text-[26px] my-6 uppercase" data-id="component__typography--heading">C.

Some Internet browsers - like Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user.

We deploy cookies and other technologies on our Service to collect information about you and your browsing activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.</p><h2 class="text-[1.5rem] font-extrabold leading-tight font-ringside text-[26px] my-6 uppercase" data-id="component__typography--heading">8.

To help protect your Personal Information and General Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">Because the Services are Internet based; however, you should assume that no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure. Therefore, although we believe the measures implemented by us and/or our Partners reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information and General Information or private communications will remain private.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">If you believe your username or password has been stolen, you are required to notify us so that necessary measures can be taken immediately.</p><h2 class="text-[1.5rem] font-extrabold leading-tight font-ringside text-[26px] my-6 uppercase" data-id="component__typography--heading">9.

We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum, could stay in the public domain indefinitely.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control.

We do not sell your Personal Information so that right will not be discussed below but the other two will (collectively, “Rights”). These Rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we cannot disclose or permit access to specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure or access would present a certain level of risk to the security of the personal information, your account with us or the security of the business’s systems of networks. If you are a California consumer, we will process your request to exercise your Rights in accordance with California Laws.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">A record concerning the requests may be maintained pursuant to our legal obligations.

For requests to disclose specific pieces of personal information collected, we will have the requestor provider at least three pieces of information so that we may verify the requestor’s identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty and additionally provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. We are required to retain the signed declarations as part of our record-keeping obligations for 24 months.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">Please note that we will never disclose a consumer’s social security number, driver’s license number, or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health information or medical identification number, an account password, or security questions and answers in response to a disclosure request.</p><p class="text-[16px] my-6">Please note additionally that we are only required to fulfil a Disclosure request from a consumer twice per every 12-month period.
