        <p class="copytext"><em><u>The right to opt-in and opt-out of sale of Personal Information</u></em> - You are
            entitled to direct us to
            stop
            disclosing your Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>
        <p class="copytext"><em><u>The right to non-discrimination</u></em> - We will not discriminate against you for
            exercising your rights
            under the
            CCPA. We will not deny you Our services, charge you different rates for Our services, or provide you a lower
            quality of services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.</p>
        <h5>How to exercise these rights?</h5><br>
        <p class="copytext">To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us on
            “privacy@kiddopia.com”.</p>
        <p class="copytext">For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you
            can only exercise
            the
            above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="copytext">provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person
                about whom we
                collected
                personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
            <li class="copytext">describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                evaluate, and
                respond to
                it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="copytext">We shall not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore
            confirm the
            personal
            information in Our possession actually relates to you. If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request,
            you
            can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf. If you are
            an
            adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority. You can submit
            a
            maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p><br>
        <h5>How and when we are expected to handle your request?</h5>
        <p class="copytext">We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information
            about how we will
            process your request. We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more
            time,
            we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we
            may
            take up to 90 days to fulfil your request.</p>
        <p class="copytext">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request
            is manifestly
            unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In
            either case, we will communicate Our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
