<p class="p1">Please see the section regarding Location Information below regarding the use of your location information and your options.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Cookies</b><br/>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and transferred to your device. We use cookies to collect information in order to improve our services for you.<br/>
You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The Help feature on most browsers provide information on how to accept cookies, disable cookies or to notify you when receiving a new cookie.</p>
<p class="p1">If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Service and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
<p class="p1">You will be notified that we are using cookies either on our web page or in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="p3">We may use cookies for the following reasons and purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><i>a. To provide the service you have asked for</i>. Some cookies are essential so you can navigate through the website and use its features. Without these cookies, we would not be able to provide the services you’ve requested. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies don’t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet. Essential cookies keep you logged in during your visit.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>b. To improve your browsing experience</i>. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features. These cookies will help remember your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences, remembering if you’ve filled in certain forms, so you’re not asked to do it again, remembering if you’ve been to the Service before and restricting the number of times you’re shown a particular advertisement. We might also use these cookies to highlight Service features that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the Service.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>c. Analytics</i>. To improve your experience on our Service, we like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don’t get used so much to help us keep our Service relevant and up to date. It’s also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our Service and if they get error messages from web pages. This group of cookies, often called “analytics cookies” are used to gather this information. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>d. To show advertising that is relevant to your interests</i>. We may sell space on our Service to advertisers. The resulting ads often contain cookies. These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>Behavioural Remarketing</b><br/>
We may use remarketing services to advertise on third party websites to you after you have visited our Service. We, and our third-party vendors use cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Service.</p>

<ul>
<li class="p3"><i>a. Your GDPR rights to be informed, to access, rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your personal information</i>. You have the right to receive free information about what personal data we have obtained about you, where it is stored, for how long, for what purposes it is used, to whom it was disclosed. You have the right to require that we, without undue delay, rectify of inaccurate personal data concerning you. That means you can request we change your personal data in our records, or have you incomplete personal data completed. You have the “right to be forgotten,” i.e. to have us delete your personal information, without undue delay, if the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected. However, GDPR gives us the right to refuse erasure if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for keeping your information.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>b. GDPR gives you the right to restrict processing</i> if any of the following applies:i. If you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing it for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy.<br/>
ii. The processing is unlawful and you oppose its erasure and request instead the restriction of its use.<br/>
iii. We no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require us to restrict processing for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.<br/>
iv. You have objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours. </li>
<li class="p3"><i>c. Right to data portability</i>. Upon request, we will provide you your personal data in our possession, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit that data to another controller if doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>d. Right to object</i>. You can object, on grounds relating your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of your personal information, if based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.  We will then have to stop processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing. If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, we will have to stop processing for these purposes.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>e. Right to withdraw consent</i>. GDPR grants you the right to withdraw your earlier given consent, if any, to the processing of your personal data at any time.</li>
<li class="p3"><i>f. Rights related to automated decision making</i>. As a responsible business, we do not rely on any automated decision making, such as profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>Did We Miss Anything?</b></p>
<p class="p1">Contact us If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email <a href="mailto:hello@mymedicwatch.com"><span class="s2">hello@mymedicwatch.com</span></a> or by mail: PO Box 3308 St Pauls, NSW 2031.</p>
