    <p>Recipe Keeper does not collect, store or share any personal information about you.</p>
    <p>Recipe, shopping list and meal planner data entered into Recipe Keeper resides only on your local device unless you register and sign in to a Recipe Keeper account.

    <p>Recipe Keeper uses your internet connection when syncing your data and when you import recipes from web sites.</p>
    <p>We will retain your data for as long as you maintain an account or as otherwise necessary to provide you with access to our services.
