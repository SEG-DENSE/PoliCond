Cities, universities, summer camps, fitness chains, endurance competition and athletic organizations, and other clients use our Solutions, including but not limited to <a href="https://www.activenetwork.com/activenet">ACTIVENet</a> and <a href="https://www.activenetwork.com/activeworks-endurance">ACTIVEWorks Endurance</a>, to register participants for their events (“Events”), to collect and maintain important information about their participants, to communicate with their participants, and to collect payments from their participants. We also maintain a publicly accessible website, <a href="https://www.active.com/">Active.com</a>, that enables fitness and recreation enthusiasts to search for or browse events hosted by our clients using event location, event type, event date, or other relevant criteria as filters; to register for events that interest them; to participate in like-minded communities; and to track their event registrations and results. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) describes how Active and our subsidiaries and affiliates collect and process personal information from and about subscribers and visitors to and users of our websites and branded social media pages (“Sites”), our web-based and mobile applications (“Apps”), our email communications and newsletters, and any of our Solutions that link to or expressly reference this Notice.</p><p>If you are an end user of our Sites, Apps, or Solutions, then our privacy practices may vary depending on the nature of your interactions with us and the jurisdiction in which you are located. Depending on the Sites, Apps, or Solutions with which you interact, Active may collect and process personal information from or about you for its own purposes, or it may do so exclusively for its clients’ purposes, in accordance with Active’s contract terms with them. If you interact with us through a client who has purchased an Active Solution to facilitate the management of their events, then that client may be a “data controller” for your personal information, and you should consult their privacy notice, in addition to this one. This Notice does not describe how our clients may use your personal information when they act as a data controller with respect to such personal information, and Active will redirect any inquiries that you make about client processing activities to the appropriate client.</p><p>If you are a client, please note that information about our disclosures, transfers and other processing of your personal information is described in your contract with Active and in the documentation provided to you at or before onboarding. For clients, this Notice therefore acts a supplement, not a replacement, to that documentation, and it relates specifically to the personal information we collect through our Sites.</p><p>For some products and services, and in certain specialized contests, we will provide additional privacy notices before collecting your personal information. For example, Active maintains specific privacy notices for job applicants, employees, and contractors, which are made available to those individuals in the proper context. Moreover, please be aware that not all of the information in this Notice will be directly applicable to our handling of your personal information. This Notice provides an overview of the possible circumstances in which we may interact with your personal information. If you have any questions, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@activenetwork.com">privacy@activenetwork.com</a> or by using the methods provided in the “Contact Us” section below.</p><p>The remainder of this Notice is organized as follows:</p><p>‍</p><p><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-1"><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTION</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-2"><strong><br>OUR PROCESSING OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-3"><strong><br>PERSONAL INFORMATION EVENT ORGANIZERS COLLECT ON ACTIVE</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-4"><strong><br>HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER PARTNERS FOR OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES </strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-5"><strong><br>HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR OWN BUSINESS PURPOSES </strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-6"><strong><br>COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-7"><strong><br>THIRD-PARTY&nbsp;ADVERTISING</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-8"><strong><br>TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-9"><strong><br>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-10"><strong><br>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MARKETING, PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING </strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-11"><strong><br>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-12"><strong><br>CHILDREN</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-13"><strong><br>CHANGES AND UPDATES</strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-14"><strong><br>CONTACT US </strong></a><a href="/information/privacy-policy#legal-15"><strong><br>REGION-SPECIFIC INFORMATION</strong></a></p></div><div id="legal-1" class="w-richtext"><p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTION </strong></p><p>Personal information is information that identifies or relates to an identifiable individual.
