For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to <a class="YfaGG" data-name="against-abuse" href="privacy#footnote-against-abuse" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">protect against abuse</a>.

And we use your information to <a class="YfaGG" data-name="make-improvements" href="privacy#footnote-make-improvements" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">make improvements</a> to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p><h3>Develop new services</h3><div class="w94E5e"></div><p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p><h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3><div class="w94E5e"></div><p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and <a class="YfaGG" data-name="customized-search" href="privacy#footnote-customized-search" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">customized search results</a>. For example, <a class="N6CPUe" href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp" target="_blank">Security Checkup</a> provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p><p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you <a class="YfaGG" data-name="personalized-ads" href="privacy#footnote-personalized-ads" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">personalized ads</a> based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in  <a class="N6CPUe" href="https://myadcenter.google.com" target="_blank">My Ad Center</a>.</p><ul><li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on <a class="YfaGG" data-name="sensitive-categories" href="privacy#footnote-sensitive-categories" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">sensitive categories</a>, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li><li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</li><li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.

For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to <a class="YfaGG" data-name="link-info" href="privacy#footnote-link-info" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">link information</a> about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.</p><h3>Communicate with you</h3><div class="w94E5e"></div><p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p><h3>Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3><div class="w94E5e"></div><p>We use information to help improve the <a class="YfaGG" data-name="safety-reliability" href="privacy#footnote-safety-reliability" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">safety and reliability</a> of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or <a class="YfaGG" data-name="the-public" href="privacy#footnote-the-public" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">the public</a>.</p><hr/><p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us <a class="YfaGG" data-name="detect-abuse" href="privacy#footnote-detect-abuse" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">detect abuse</a> such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use <a class="YfaGG" data-name="algorithm" href="privacy#footnote-algorithm" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">algorithms</a> to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p><p>We may <a class="YfaGG" data-name="combine-info" href="privacy#footnote-combine-info" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">use the information we collect</a> across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, <a class="YfaGG" data-name="other-sites" href="privacy#footnote-other-sites" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">your activity on other sites and apps</a> may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p><p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p><p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p></div></div><div class="xXnO1d"><div class="nrAB0c"><div class="ahbJ5" id="infochoices"></div><div class="eUtKLe"><div class="M3GAob"><div class="O3bgpc"></div></div></div><h1>Your privacy controls</h1><h2>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</h2><p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p><p>A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:</p><pre>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -<br/>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -<br/>Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 -<br/>740674ce2123e969</pre><ul><li><code>123.45.67.89</code> is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP.

(Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</li></ul><h3 id="footnote-unique-id">Unique identifiers</h3><p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p><p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about <a href="technologies/cookies">how Google uses cookies</a>.</p><p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be <a href="technologies/ads">managed</a> in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p><h2>Additional Context</h2><h3 id="footnote-activity-on-services">Activity on Google Services</h3><p>If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web &amp; App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web &amp; App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy.</p><p>In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.</p><p>You can view and control your Web &amp; App Activity at <a class="N6CPUe" href="https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols" target="_blank">My Activity</a>.</p><h3 id="footnote-activity-on-third-party">activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</h3><p>Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us.</p><p>This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use.
