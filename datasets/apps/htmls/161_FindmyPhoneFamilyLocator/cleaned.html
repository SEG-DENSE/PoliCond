<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
<p><b>To identify you in the App system</b>, you are required to enter your phone number. This processing of your phone number is necessary to form a contract with you (Terms of Use).</p>
<p><b>When you start using the App</b>, we automatically collect the following data:</p>

<p>We use this information to provide you with the App’s functionalities and to improve its performance. This data processing is based on the necessity to fulfill our contract with you (Terms of Use).</p>
<p><b>When you create an account in the App</b>, we process your account details, such as your email, phone number, name, and optional profile picture. If you log in using Google, Facebook, or similar accounts, we do not store the data from those accounts; instead, you voluntarily provide your email, name, and phone number, which are securely linked to your account in our database. This information is used to create your account in our system and is processed based on the necessity to fulfill our contract with you (Terms of Use).</p>
<p>
<b>Third-Party Account Integration</b><br/>
                    When you choose to log into our App using a third-party account such as Facebook or Google, we may receive certain information from that service to facilitate the login process. This information typically includes your name, email address, and profile picture. Please note that we do not store your login credentials from these third-party services. The use of your data from these third-party accounts is subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review these policies to understand how your information is handled.

<p><b>When you add someone to your group or join a group</b>, we process information about the groups you belong to, based on the performance of our contract with you (Terms of Use).</p>
<p><b>To provide the core functionality of the App</b>, we need access to your precise location and movement history. Without this, providing the App’s main features will be impossible. We process your location data based on your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time, but please note that doing so will prevent the App from functioning as intended.</p>
<p><b>When you use the “invite a user” feature</b>, we may process the contact details of the person you invite, such as their phone number. Please ensure that you have a legal basis to provide us with such information.</p>

<p><b>If you contact us with a support request</b>, we process the data you provide in your request, such as your name (optional), email address, the nature of your request, and any attached files (if applicable). This data is processed based on our legitimate interest in providing you with support, balanced against your interest in receiving assistance.</p>

This could be the app store if you pay through it or a third-party payment processor, as outlined below. We do not store your full payment details. However, for payments made through our website, we retain certain payment-related information (such as last 4 digits of your card and card brand) along with payment receipts (including the package name and the date and time of the purchase) to confirm your subscription status. This data is processed based on the necessity to fulfill our contract with you (Terms of Use).</p>
