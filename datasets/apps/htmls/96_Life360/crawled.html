<p>Life360 takes special precautions to protect the privacy of our younger members. Life360 does not knowingly collect personal information from children who do not meet applicable minimum age requirements without verifiable consent of a parent or guardian, and our Services are only intended to be used by children with significant parental or guardian involvement and approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Life360 learns that we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child without parental consent as required by law, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with our Services or is using our Products without your consent, please alert us immediately by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@life360.com</a>.</p>
<p>As a parent or guardian, by enabling your child to create a member account and/or permitting your child to use the Products or Services, you expressly agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your child’s personal information as described herein.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5P10XQHT0YP7MTV9F1FMD"><strong>A. Setting up a Child Account</strong></h4>
<p>If a parent wishes to add a member who is a child to our Services, we request the parent provide verifiable consent, through one of several methods, such as by verifying the parent’s driver’s license during sign up, or by submitting a parental consent form (available <a href="https://life360-website-cdn.life360.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/consent.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) via mail or email. The child will then be able to participate in most aspects of the Life360 Services. In some instances, our Products are intended to be worn and used by children and pets. By providing the Products to a child, you represent and warrant to Life360 that you consent to such child’s use of our Products and Services and further consent as a parent to enable and permit Life360’s collection and use of the information from the Products and Services used by the child as stated in this Privacy Policy and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.life360.com/terms_of_use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5PB3VM0NQ01THF9T19ZRJ"><strong>B. Personal Information We Collect about Children</strong></h4>
<p>We take special precautions to collect only as much information as is reasonably necessary for the child to use our Products and Services.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5PQ6F62Y2CR3A1PQ09CRJ"><strong>C. Information Disclosures about Children</strong></h4>
<p>Life360 may disclose a child’s personal information to our third-party vendors, service providers, and business partners that offer integrated services as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not share or sell personal information of members we know to be children, nor do we show ads&nbsp; in child accounts. Profile and location information for children using the Service may be shared with other members of any Circle the child joins. Please note the child may exchange messages with those Circle members. You are responsible for monitoring your child’s account and location-sharing activity through our Products and Services and for blocking or permitting location-sharing features.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5QQG4DH5EJ588YCRHZA7G"><strong>D. Contact Us Regarding your Child’s Account or Information</strong></h4>
<p>The parent or legal guardian has a right to request to review or have deleted the child’s personal information and may withdraw consent for our Products and Services to collect any further personal information from the child. Please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@life360.com</a> to request to review and/or delete any personal information we may have collected from the child, or to withdraw permission for Life360 to collect any additional information from the child.

<h3 id="h_01GNX5R42KP6S1QGAAGTJ21DPN"><strong>VII. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h3>

<h4 id="h_01GNX5RG7AHZD986QJG5JX6WSB"><strong>A. Security&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>We have implemented appropriate standards to reduce the risk of unauthorized or unlawful access of your personal information. No security system is impenetrable and we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of our systems and your information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will never send you unsolicited messages or contact you by phone to request sensitive information, such as your account ID, password, payment, or national ID numbers. Please note that the e-mails and other communications you send to us are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to share any sensitive information through these means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify any impacted individuals and take steps in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5RWAKDBC80HTGAJGKNEWE"><strong>B. Accuracy and Confidentiality of Your Email Address and Password</strong></h4>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and ensuring the email address associated with your account(s) is accurate.

We recommend using a strong password unique to this service. If you believe your account has been compromised, change your password immediately via the applicable app or website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life360 is not responsible for information or data transmitted to a third party as a result of a member providing an incorrect phone number or email address.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5S9FW54VCA6KYPC05KR2Q"><strong>C. Jiobit Device Security</strong></h4>
<p>Jiobit devices use unique hardware to deliver strong security and encryption. Our devices include a dedicated security chip required to communicate with our secure servers and are intrusion resistant. Unlike most other connected devices, it cannot be reprogrammed - part of the circuit board is physically burned away during manufacturing. Jiobit location data is encrypted at rest and while in transit.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5ST3SDY9M4YNRWF68NP2N"><strong>D. Fraud Prevention</strong></h4>
<p>To prevent the misuse of our Services by bots or other nefarious means, we use anti-bot services to ensure the integrity of our service, for more information click&nbsp;<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/16044114529815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="h_01GNX5TGJM2ZDZ94SJ15YJT4T9"><strong>E. Data Retention</strong></h4>
<p>Life360 retains the information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Products or Services or as otherwise necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, to resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business interests, enforce our agreements, and to comply with applicable laws. The purposes for which we process information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Authorized Agents</em></p>
<p>If you reside in California, you may also designate an authorized agent to submit an access, deletion, or correction request on your behalf. Authorized agents must submit the request via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com">privacy@life360.com</a> and include a signed letter from the Life360 member confirming the agent has permission to submit the request on the member's behalf. In certain circumstances, we may need to request additional information to verify the identity of the member about whom the request is being made and/or to verify that the member has provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent's authority to act on your behalf.</p>

Your information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Life360, you explicitly consent to the storage of your information in these locations, this may mean that your personal information will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal information than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside your jurisdiction by: (i) processing it in compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as described <a href="#h_01GNX5XTFG8CYJ0HFEFVXD8FVF">below</a>; and/or (ii) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses, or another lawful and approved transfer mechanism.

<p>If you are located in Europe, the following section applies to you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong></em></p>
<p>Our legal basis for processing your personal information varies depending on the type of information we collect and the context in which we collect it as well as our records of your country of residence. Depending on where you reside, we may rely on different legal bases to process your information.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or in a jurisdiction where similar legal requirements may apply such as Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we rely on a number of legal bases to process information about you. We will process information about you where we have your consent, where we have a legitimate interest to do so, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and/or where we have a legal obligation to process your information. For example we typically rely on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessity to meet an actual contractual obligation when you create a Life360, Tile or Jiobit account to enable us to provide you with our Products and Services.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Consent when placing cookies on your device on the web (through our cookie consent manager), to send you email marketing, or to deliver third-party targeted advertising to you related to our Products and Services. Note that when consent is the legal basis for our processing of your personal information, you may withdraw such consent at any time.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Our legitimate interests to process your information when providing you with customer service support, to serve targeted marketing of our Products and Services, for fraud prevention and security purposes.<br><br>

You may exercise these rights by following the instructions in the <a href="#h_01GNX5K5VEPZ3H202GEGY19SS7">Your Choices About Your Information</a> section above. Alternatively, you may submit a request to exercise your rights via email by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com">privacy@life360.com</a>.

Life360 is in the business of helping you find what matters. In order to give you the best experience, we use advertising technologies like pixels to help deliver relevant messages to you about our products and services, as well as to help us measure the effectiveness of those messages. In some instances, our advertising partners may glean information about things like your visit to our website and/or purchases you’ve made. Under California law, this is included in the definition of “sale” and thus triggers the requirement for this “do not sell” disclosure.
