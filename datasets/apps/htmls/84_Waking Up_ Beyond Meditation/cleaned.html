<p>Effective Date: December 1, 2023.</p>
<p>When you use Waking Up, you’re trusting us to handle your personal information with care. We take that trust seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how Waking Up LLC collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal information when you use our Waking Up app or WakingUp.com.</p>
<h2>Key Privacy Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>We hope you read this entire Privacy Policy for full detail, but here are some key points:</li>
<li>Our money comes from you, not ads. As a consumer-focused subscription business, we rely on your subscriptions to offer our app.</li>
<li>Other platforms may sell your sensitive personal information for targeted advertising, but we don’t.</li>
<li>We have a wide catalogue of sessions on meditation, mindfulness, and related topics, including content specific to areas like anxiety, happiness, and psychological well-being.  We only ever process data about your use of our content so that we can learn more about what you’re most interested in, serve you the best possible experience, and communicate with you.</li>
<li>We use a small number of trusted online software platforms, like Google Analytics, to help  deliver and optimize our website and app.</li>
<li>We honor all requests to exercise privacy rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wakingup.com">privacy@wakingup.com</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<h3>a. Marketing Communications</h3>
<p>You can unsubscribe from Waking Up marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in a marketing email or contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wakingup.com">privacy@wakingup.com</a>.</p>
<h3>b. Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>You can make certain choices regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. We recommend doing so by clicking the “Cookie Preferences” link in the footer of our website, adjusting your preferences, and clicking “Save Settings.  If you replace, change, upgrade or reset your browser or device, or delete your cookies, or if you use a browser that automatically clears your cookies, you may need to use this opt-out tool again.</p>
<p>You may be able to set your browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being used. Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage and other technologies too. However, if you block or otherwise reject all cookies, local storage, JavaScript or other technologies, certain websites may not function as expected.</p>
<p>We do not respond to browser-based do-not-track signals.</p>
<h3>c. Rights Regarding Your Information</h3>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make certain requests related to your personal information. For example, you may have the right to ask us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide you access to or a copy of certain personal information.</li>
<li>Correct or update personal information.</li>
<li>Delete certain personal information.</li>
<li>Restrict or opt you out of certain uses of your information (right to object).</li>
<li>Withdraw any consent that you previously provided;</li>
<li>Provide you with certain details regarding the processing of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the app to you, so we can’t delete it while still providing you with the app.</p>
<p>We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to certain requests, which may require verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may be unable to respond to your requests.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any privacy rights, or raise a complaint about our handling of your personal information, please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may be able to designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request as permitted by applicable law.  </p>
<p>Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
<p>Residents of California, Virginia, Nevada, and a growing number of other jurisdictions have a right to opt out of what the laws in those states call a “sale” of personal information, as well as to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of personal information for certain targeted advertising purposes. To exercise those rights, they can visit our Your Privacy Choices page and follow the instructions there.</p>
<h2>5. Details for Californians</h2>
<p>This section applies only to California residents, and it deals only with information that is subject to the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA). Data about individuals who live outside California may be handled differently.</p>
<p>During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we collected all of the types of personal information listed below (as further described in the “Information We Collect” section of this Privacy Policy) above. During that period, we made the following disclosures of that information for the purposes described in the “Disclosure of Information” section above:</p>

<p>The CCPA defines the “sale” of personal information to include selling user data to random third parties for money, like a data broker does—something we have never done. But it also defines “sale” and “sharing” in a broader sense that includes some more common practices. For example, under the CCPA, these terms include the use of certain advertising services, like when we pay an ad tech company to place a cookie on the browser of a visitor to our website so that the user can see an ad for our app on other websites. We’ve done that over the last year and plan to continue to do so. The ad tech company can see the website visitor’s IP address and other browser/device data as part of that process. The terms “sale” and “sharing” also cover the use of other advertising services, like if we were to pay a third-party website to serve ads for us to individuals that we specify by giving that website a list of those individuals’ email addresses (or hashes of those email address). We’re starting that activity in 2023 (and may have started by the time you read this), and it’s considered a “sale” and “sharing," even though we’re the ones who pay for it.</p>
<p>We do not “sell” or “share” personal information (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.</p>
<p>Californians can opt out of the CCPA “sales” and “sharing” by following the instructions on our Your Privacy Choices page, or they can start their request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wakingup.com">privacy@wakingup.com</a> and then completing the instructions we send in response. Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). WakingUp.com treats qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” or “sharing” of any California personal information that is collected on that site from that browser using cookies and similar technology.  You can override that treatment for a GPC-enabled browser by using the cookie controls available from the website’s footer to opt into particular categories of cookies from that browser.  In that case, “sales” and “sharing” via cookies and similar technology in those categories may resume on that browser. Regardless of how you opt out of “sales” and “sharing,” most of the disclosures described in this privacy policy will continue, as they don’t qualify as “sales” or “sharing.”</p>
<p>The CCPA also entitles you to receive certain information from us about certain kinds of financial incentives that we may offer (when we offer them), and it prohibits various forms of discrimination against you for exercising your rights.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, the CCPA allows consumers to request that businesses limit their use of certain sensitive personal information due to its sensitive nature. However, we do not engage in such uses of that information.</p>
<h2>6. International Data Transfer</h2>
<p>We are headquartered in the United States, and recipients of the data disclosures described in this Privacy Policy are located in the United States and elsewhere in the world, including where privacy laws may not provide as much protection as the laws of your country where you live. For this reason, your personal information may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of any of the countries where we (or the recipients of disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy) operate, pursuant to the laws of such countries. However, this Privacy Policy applies to Waking Up’s operations worldwide. To the extent that personal information is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK to any non-EEA members of our group or third-party processors who handle the information solely on our behalf, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures include signing Standard Contractual Clauses in accordance with EEA and UK data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as set out below.</p>
<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We keep your information until we determine it is no longer than necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and we are not legally required to retain it for longer.</p>
<h2>8. Protection of Information</h2>
<p>To help protect personal information, we have put in place physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. However, we cannot assure you that data that we collect under this Privacy Policy will never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Privacy.</p>
<h2>9. Children Under 13</h2>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 (or a higher age threshold where applicable) has given us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wakingup.com">privacy@wakingup.com</a> so that we can delete it.</p>
<h2>10. Updates and Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, such as to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. We will post those changes here or on a similarly accessible page.</p>
<h2>11. Contacting Us</h2>
