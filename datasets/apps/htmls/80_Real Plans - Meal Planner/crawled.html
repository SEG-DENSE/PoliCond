(We also can’t abide services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</p><p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p><p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p><h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;">We collect the following types of information about you:</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Information you provide us directly:&nbsp;</span>We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a Real Plans account, or if you correspond with us. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Information we may receive from third parties:&nbsp;</span>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Real Plans application, linking your account to the Real Plans Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Real Plans. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Real Plans. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Real Plans Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Inviting a friend to use Real Plans:&nbsp;</span>Real Plans may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to Real Plans through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Finding your friends on the Service:&nbsp;</span>Real Plans may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with Real Plans accounts through a “Find friends” feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Real Plans. If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide Real Plans access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using Real Plans. If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on Real Plans.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Analytics information:&nbsp;</span>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Cookies information:&nbsp;</span>Full details can be found on our&nbsp;Cookie Policy. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Real Plans help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Full details can be found on our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Log file information:&nbsp;</span>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><em>Device identifiers:</em> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Real Plans. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Location data:&nbsp;</span>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Commercial and marketing communications:&nbsp;</span>We use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails. You may also be able to be “found” on Real Plans based on information that you provide (see “Find friends on Real Plans”) above.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Use of certain service type information we collect about you:&nbsp;</span>We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the Real Plans application on your mobile devices.</p><h3 class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c3" style="font-weight: bold;">Sharing of Your Information</span></h3><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;">We will not rent or sell your personal information into third parties outside Real Plans.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><em>Instances where we are required to share your information:&nbsp;</em>Real Plans will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Real Plans, our Users, or others.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:&nbsp;</span>We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</p><h3 class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c3" style="font-weight: bold;">How We Store and Protect Your Information</span></h3><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Storage and Processing:&nbsp;</span>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Real Plans or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities. Real Plans may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Real Plans or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Keeping your information safe:&nbsp;</span>Real Plans cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Real Plans, at all times. However, Real Plans cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Real Plans or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Real Plans Service, such as social networks. Real Plans is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c0" style="font-style: italic;">Compromise of information:&nbsp;</span>In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Real Plans will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p><h3 class="c1" style="color: #000000;"><span class="c3" style="font-weight: bold;">Your Choices about Your Information</span></h3><p class="c1" style="color: #000000;">We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests.
