      Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all personal data collected or submitted through

      SECTION 5 - WHEN DO WE TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EU
    </h4> <p class="tw-mb-4">
      If your personal data is subject to GDPR, in the course of providing the Services to you, we
      may transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area
      ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), principally to our servers in the United States; this means that
      your personal data will not have the automatic protection of European data protection laws
      (including the GDPR) which apply in the EEA. In these circumstances, in order to ensure that
      your personal data continues to have adequate protection when it is transferred outside the
      EEA, your personal data will only be transferred on one of the following bases:
    </p> <ol class="tw-mb-4 tw-pl-4 tw-list-decimal"><li>
        Where the transfer is subject to one or more of the appropriate safeguards for
        international transfers prescribed by applicable law (for example, standard data protection
        clauses adopted by the European Commission);
      </li> <li>
        a European Commission decision provides that the country or territory to which the transfer
        is made ensures an adequate level of protection; or
      </li> <li>
        there exists another situation where the transfer is permitted under applicable law (for
        example, where we have your explicit consent).

      You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal data when it is
      transferred outside the EEA by contacting us using the details set out below.

      SECTION 6 - ONWARD TRANSFERS
    </h4> <p class="tw-mb-4">
      We require third-party controllers to whom we disclose your personal data to contractually
      agree to (i) only process such personal data for the limited and specified purposes
      consistent with the consent you provide; (ii) provide the same level of protection to your
      personal data as required under this Privacy Policy; and (iii) notify us if the third-party
      controller makes a determination that it can no longer meet the foregoing obligations.
    </p> <p class="tw-mb-4">
      In addition, when we transfer your personal data to a third party processor acting as our
      agent, we will: (i) transfer such personal data only for the limited and specified purposes
      consistent with the request or consent you provide; (ii) contractually require the processor
      to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy
      Policy; and (iii) require the processor to notify us if it makes a determination that it can
      no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by this

      us are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including

      California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights
    </h4> <p class="tw-mb-4">
      California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses
      to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business’ practices related
      to disclosing personal data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
      Alternatively, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal data of
      customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer
      has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.

      privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or liability in
      connection therewith. If you do not want the services that tracking technologies provide, you
      may be able to opt-out of certain of such tracking technologies or limit such tracking
      technologies by visiting www.optout.networkadvertising.org, using script-blockers, and
