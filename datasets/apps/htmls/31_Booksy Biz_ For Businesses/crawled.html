<p>
</p><h2><strong>3.9 Customer Reviews of SMBs.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Customers who book services with a SMB through Booksy may have the opportunity to leave a review (“Review”) for the SMB. In addition to complying with all requirements for reviews as may be set forth by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) the rules for publishing and removing Reviews are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Booksy is not responsible for the content of any Review published by a Customer;</li>
    <li>the Customer is allowed to provide a Review only in relation to the appointment that took place. SMB may request to remove the Review only if the SMB marks the appointment as a no-show within 24 hours from the scheduled appointment;</li>
    <li>the Review shall relate only to the professional activities provided by SMB and be based solely on the personal experience of the Customer; </li>
    <li>the Customer shall not publish Reviews that: (i) are false or intentionally misleading, (ii) contain harmful, defamatory or unethical content or violate the law, personal rights, in particular, they shall not contain vulgar or offensive expressions, refer to private and family life or call for violence or hatred, including racial, religious or ethnic hatred or against sexual minorities;</li>
    <li>Booksy may refuse to publish a Review or to remove an already published Review if, in Booksy's sole and exclusive opinion, it violates the Terms of Use or the provisions of law. However, Booksy does not settle disputes between SMB and the Customer and does not verify the veracity of Reviews;</li>
    <li>removal of the Review is irreversible;</li>
    <li>Customers shall be given the opportunity to provide their opinions about performed services of SMBs; therefore, requests for blocking the possibility of providing Reviews or deletion Reviews posted by Customers will not be considered unless the Review otherwise violates these Terms. </li>
</ol>
<p><br>Reviews submitted by Customers who have used the services of a given SMB via a booking made in the Booksy Application are marked with the tag 'Verified User by Booksy.' Regarding these reviews, Booksy ensures that they originate solely from Customer accounts who have utilized the services of the specific SMB. Only after the SMB's Service has been fulfilled do Customers gain the ability to publish reviews. As for reviews that do not possess the 'Verified User by Booksy' tag, Booksy does not guarantee that such opinions come from Customers who have used the services of the specific SMB.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>Part IV – Terms of Sale for Booking Services, Payment Services, Booksy Card Reader, Tap to Pay, and SMB Rankings in Search Results.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>4.1. Appointment Booking.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Booksy provides the Booking Services to Users for the purpose of assisting Customers in discovering and booking appointments with a variety of participating SMBs and of assisting SMBs in more efficiently managing their calendars and increasing their customer base. In response to a Customer’s online request for a SMB appointment through the Booksy Site or Booksy Application, Booksy directly contacts the SMB’s computerized database of appointments. The availability of appointments is determined at the time of User’s query and is provided by the SMB. Users understand and agree that Booksy does not independently verify the availability of any SMB and cannot be held liable for errors in a SMB’s calendar, such as double-booking or bookings that are not honored by the SMB. Once an appointment is made by a Customer through the Booksy Site or Booksy Application, Booksy will provide confirmation of the appointment to both the Customer and SMB by email to the email address provided by said User upon registration. By using the Booking Services, Users agree to receive appointment confirmations and reminders by email, SMS, push notifications, and/or any chatbot-related or voice-assisted technology with which Booksy may engage. Booksy shall not be held liable in the event an appointment confirmation or reminder is not sent to or received by a User.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>4.2. Appointment No-Show &amp; Cancellation Policy.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Booksy is committed to providing quality services to Customers and SMBs. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service for SMBs and their patrons, Customers must make every reasonable effort to cancel any appointments that they will be unable to honor as soon in advance of the appointment as possible. You may cancel your appointment via the Booksy Site or Booksy Application. Appointments should not be canceled by calling the SMB directly. Some SMBs may require a debit or credit card number to finalize your appointment booking and place a hold on the SMB’s calendar. In order to use the Booking Services for these SMBs, you must provide valid debit or credit card information and a specific amount could be blocked or prepaid, and you may be required to cancel your appointment in accordance with the SMB’s stated cancellation policy, which will be disclosed at the time the appointment is made. Booksy uses this debit or credit card information as described in our Privacy Policy and shall have no liability for any charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your appointment in accordance with an SMB's cancellation policy. Please note that a cancellation fee may be charged only if the Customer has self-canceled the appointment through the processes described above or the SMB has recorded a no-show. </p>
<p>Be advised: you may be charged a cancellation fee indicated during the booking process or lose the amount blocked or paid, if you arrange a Booking Service, but cancel late or no-show, thus committing a breach of a stated cancellation policy of the SMB. In case it is not otherwise specified, the refund of any amount blocked or pre-paid rests solely with the SMB. Booksy shall have no liability for refunding such amounts to the Customers, nor is Booksy responsible for verifying whether the Customer has provided valid debit or credit card information or has sufficient funds in Customer’s bank account to complete a transaction. </p>
<p>Customers who cancel or fail to show up for multiple bookings may have their Accounts terminated, at the sole discretion of Booksy, in the event that such account activity is detrimental to orderly Booking Services with SMBs and members of the Booksy community.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>4.3. Usage Guidelines.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>User agrees to use the Booking Services only to book appointments at SMBs and then honor those appointments by arriving at SMBs on time and paying for the services booked and provided.

<p>To confirm that the payment card information you have provided is accurate, we may place a temporary $1.00 authorization hold on your debit or credit card at the time you provide your payment card information through the Booksy Application. After we verify that your payment card information is accurate, usually within a few days, the $1.00 hold will be removed. In no event will your payment card actually be charged for this $1.00 authorization.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers (such as payment processors providers) to process payments and manage debit and credit card information.</p>

For any transaction that results in a chargeback, Booksy will withhold the chargeback amount in a reserve from the amounts payable to SMB. We may recoup the amount of any chargeback and any associated fees and fines assessed by a network or our processor. In addition to the forgoing, be advised that Booksy may charge a chargeback processing fee. If you have pending chargebacks, we may delay payments, and if we reasonably believe that a chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time that: (a) a chargeback is assessed due to a Customer complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which your customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>
<p>If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, or (d) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.</p>
<p>We will assist you, when requested and at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Payment Services, the Booksy Card Reader, or a Tap to Pay subscription. To that end, you permit us to share information about a chargeback with the Customer, the Customer’s financial institution, our payment processor, payment networks and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the chargeback. If the chargeback is contested successfully, we will release corresponding reserved funds to your account. If a chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the chargeback, we may recover the chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within seven (7) calendar days of our request, may result in an irreversible chargeback.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.17. Withholding of Funds.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Where we, in our reasonable opinion, are required to do so by law, we reserve the right to withhold funds for services that we reasonably deem suspicious with regard to money laundering, Unauthorized Business, fraud, or other illegal activities or in case of any other chargebacks or revocations.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.18. Payouts.</strong></h2>

<p>Once you create your SMB Account, through the secure form you will have the opportunity to designate a deposit account into which you wish to be paid out.

<p>In the event your payout account becomes negative, you agree that we have the right to offset any incoming payments against the negative balance. Should you fail to bring your account to positive, we may block you from accepting further payments and institute legal proceedings for collection.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.19. Responsibility for Accurate Pay Out Information.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate deposit account information for payout. You agree to promptly update your SMB Account and other information, including your address, email address and bank account information, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.20. Deposits.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Booksy may require the SMB to maintain deposits in an escrow account to act as a provision against chargebacks and refunds. The amount of such deposits will be determined by Booksy.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.21. Processing Errors.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of fewer funds than you were entitled, we will credit your SMB Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more funds than you were entitled, Booksy will debit the extra funds from your SMB Account or your linked bank account. You shall remit to Booksy the difference within thirty (30) calendar days of demand therefore. We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) calendar days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history may be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.22. Refunds.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>By accepting card transactions through the Payment Services, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for your goods or services in accordance with these Terms. You are obliged to disclose your refund or cancellation policy to Customers at the time of purchase and/or booking, as applicable, and can refund transactions up to thirty (30) calendar days following the date of said transaction. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return merchandise. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Customer, you may still receive a chargeback relating to such sales.</p>
<p>Booksy will automatically process refunds on your behalf from your available balance or deposit amount and shall not be liable for refunds made in error or in violation of your own policies. If your available balance or deposit amount is insufficient to cover the refund, Booksy will withdraw the requested refund amount and credit it back to your Customer. Further refunds may be accepted but will only be processed once your account shows a positive balance. For every refund Booksy may charge a refund processing fee.</p>
<p>Booksy has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf pursuant to the applicable Network Rules (as defined below.) By using the Payment Services, you agree to comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations set forth by the payment processing networks and Ayden N.V. (“Network Rules”). The payment processing networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. Booksy may be required to change these terms in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at&nbsp;<a href="https://visa.com/">https://visa.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/">https://www.mastercard.com</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/merchantopguide">https://www.americanexpress.com/merchantopguide</a>.

<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.23. Handling of Liens; Right to Set-Off; Collection Rights.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We are entitled to set-off any and all claims against amounts payable to Booksy by SMB. In addition, to the maximum extent provided by law, we may collect any and all obligations due and owing by you to us by deducting them from your pending transactions in the deposit account. Fees shall be assessed at the time of transaction processing and will be deducted from the funds received. Your failure to pay all amounts due and oning shall be deemed an immediate breach of this Agreement for which you will be liable. You further agree to pay all fees and costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred by or on our behalf arising from or related to the collection of any unpaid obligations by you.</p>
<p>In addition to any other fees set forth in these Terms, Booksy may also charge a SMB, at Booksy’s standard rates, for research, including, but not limited to, (i) research required to respond to any third party or government subpoena, levy or garnishment on a SMB account, and (2) research and activities necessary to verify and execute any payee change, whether pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (as discussed further below) or court order.</p>
<p>You also understand that, as provided under Section 9-406 of the Uniform Commercial Code, we may be required, upon receipt of a notice of assignment and payment direction from your secured party (for example, lender), to pay all or a portion of your fees as directed by your secured party. If we receive such a notice and direction, we will, after deducting our fees and expenses of compliance as provided above, make payments to your secured party as so directed without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>6.24. Payment of Taxes.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason for your use of the Payment Services (“Taxes”). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. If you are a SMB based in the United States and in a given calendar year you process (i) more than $20,000 in gross amount of payments and (ii) more than Two Hundred (200) payments, Booksy or its payment processor may be required by law to report information about you and your use of the Payment Services to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). For purposes of determining whether you have met the IRS reporting threshold, the gross amount does not include any adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts or any other amounts. Whether you reach $20,000 in payments or more than Two Hundred (200) payments will be determined by looking at our Payment Service information associated with your SMB Account. In order to be able to meet said regulatory obligations, before SMB meets the thresholds, we will need additional information, including a completed IRS form W9 for U.S.-based SMBs. We are entitled to block the Payment Services for a SMB that fails to provide us with all the needed information based on the applicable taxation rules and regulations.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><h2><strong>Part IX: Disclaimers; Limitations Of Liability; Indemnification</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>9.1. Disclaimer Of Warranty; Limitation Of Liability.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>You agree that use of the Services is at your sole risk. Neither us nor our affiliates nor any respective employees, agents, third-party content providers or licensors warrant that the use of the Services shall be uninterrupted or error free; nor do we make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services or as to the accuracy, reliability, or content of any information provided.</p>
<p>Any downloadable software, products, or other materials, without limitation, is provided on an "as is" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement, or any warranty arising from a course of dealing, performance, or trade usage, other than those warranties which are implied by and incapable of exclusion, restriction, or modification under the laws applicable to these Terms of Use. Booksy does not warrant that your use of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that Booksy will review the information or materials made available through the Services for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain any such information or materials without loss. Booksy shall not be liable for delays, interruptions, service failures, or other problems inherent in use of the internet and electronic communications or other systems outside the reasonable control of Booksy. The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Although all information and materials carried on Services are believed to be reliable, we make no representations, neither expressly nor impliedly, as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of the Services.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we, our employees, subsidiaries, parents, agents, partners, third-party content providers, affiliates, vendors, and/or our or their respective directors and officers be liable for any injuries, losses, claims, or direct damages or any special, exemplary, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, or otherwise, including but not limited to loss of profits, personal injury or death, property damage, reputational harm, or loss of information or data, and even if advised of the possibility of such damages, which arise out of or are any way connected with or relate to (1) this Agreement, (2) any use of the Services, hardware or accessories, materials, or the user content, (3) any failure or delay (including, but not limited to, the use or inability to use any component of the booking services or payment services), or (4) your visit to any SMB or the performance, non-performance, conduct, or policies of any SMB or Customer in connection with the Services. In addition, you specifically understand and agree that any third party directing you to the Booksy site by referral, link, or any other means is not liable to user for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, damages or loss associated with the use of the Services. Booksy is neither an agent of nor otherwise associated with any SMB for which a Customer has made a reservation or paid a bill using the Payment Services.</p>
<p>We disclaim any and all liability of any kind for any unauthorized access to or use of your personally-identifiable information. By utilizing the Services, you acknowledge and agree to our disclaimer of any such liability. If you do not agree, you should not access or otherwise utilize the Services. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to certain Users.</p>
<p>The above limitations shall survive these Terms and inure to the benefit of us and our affiliates and respective directors, officers, employees, and agents. You and Booksy understand and agree that the disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations in this Section 9.1 are essential elements of this Agreement and that they represent a reasonable allocation of risk. In particular, you understand that Booksy would be unable to make the Services available to you except on these terms and agree that this Agreement will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>9.2. Indemnification.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless, as well as our affiliates and vendors and respective directors, officers, users, and agents, from and against all claims, suits, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to (a) your use of the Booksy Site and/or the Mobile Booksy Application; (b) your noncompliance with or breach of this agreement; (c) your use of third-party services, platforms, products, links, advertisements, and/or tools; (d) your violations of any third-party rights, including third-party intellectual property rights in submissions and feedback; (e) the unauthorized use of the Services by any other person using your information; (f) your failure to comply with the network rules or pci-dss security standards, including the compromise of any payment information.</p>

You hereby release the Booksy from any and all such Claims. In connection with the foregoing, if you are a California resident, you hereby waive California civil code section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” You hereby expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under that section and any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to the release of any unknown or unsuspected claims you may have against the Booksy pertaining to the subject matter of this Section 9.3.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>Part X - Governing Law; Arbitration Agreement And Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>10.1. Governing Law.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>This Agreement is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware for those Users who enter into this Agreement with Booksy, Inc., and the country of Poland for those Users who enter into this Agreement with Booksy International Sp. z.o.o., without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>10.2. Arbitration.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitration choice related to the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Booksy or its successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitrating.</p>
<p>Arbitration shall be subject to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from UNCIRAL. As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the UNICTRAL’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that you file in small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. You and Booksy must abide by the following rules: (1) any claims brought by you or Booksy must be brought in the party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (2) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and may not award class-wide relief; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Booksy will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) Booksy also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Booksy may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
<p>With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (1) or (2) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Booksy shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in New York, New York.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>Part XI – Miscellaneous.</strong></h2>

<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.3. Authority.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that it is binding upon such Party and enforceable in accordance with its Terms.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.4. Waiver.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Any waiver of any rights under these Terms of Use shall only be effective if agreed or declared in writing. A delay in exercising a right or the non-exercise of a right shall not be deemed a waiver and shall not prevent a party from exercising that right in the future. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.5. Force Majeure.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We shall not be bound to meet any obligation if prevented from doing so as a consequence of acts of God or force majeure, including but not limited to measures taken or imposed by any government or public authority or in case of any other event beyond the control of us, including but not limited to natural disasters (such as a storm, hurricane, fire, flood, earthquake), war, civil unrest, terrorist activities, states of emergency, government sanctions, embargos, nationalizations, strikes and breakdowns of public utilities (such as electricity or telecommunication services). We shall use all reasonable efforts to notify you of the circumstances causing the delay and to resume performance as soon as possible, both without undue delay.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.6. Assignment.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>This Agreement and the rights granted and obligations undertaken hereunder may not be transferred, assigned, or delegated in any manner by User, but may be freely transferred, assigned, or delegated by Booksy.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.7. Rights of Third Parties.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>These Terms do not give any right to any third party unless explicitly stated herein.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.8. Relationship of the Parties.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The parties are independent contractors under these Terms, and nothing herein shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between them. Neither party has authority to enter into terms of any kind in the name of the other party or of any third-party that may have a right pursuant to these Terms.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.9. Severability.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in effect.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>11.10. Notices.</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices shall be given by postal mail to Booksy Inc, 515 North State Street, Suite 460, Chicago, IL 60654, and in the case of any User, to the email address you provide to us (either during the registration process or when your email address changes).
