including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you ("Request to Know");</li>
<li>Delete the personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions ("Request to Delete");</li>
<li>Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you ("Request to Correct");</li>
<li>Opt you out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt-out of the sharing of your personal information, please use the following online form or you may choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"). We will process the GPC signal as a request to opt out; and</li>
<li>Not provide discriminatory treatment for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CCPA, including an employee’s, applicant’s, or independent contractor’s right to not be retaliated against for the exercise of their CCPA rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not offer a right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information because, within the meaning of the CCPA, we do not use sensitive personal information for inferring characteristics.</p>
<p>We do not offer a right to opt-out of the sale of personal information because, within the meaning of the CCPA, we do not sell personal information.</p>
<p>In order to submit a request, we will need to verify your identity. If you have an account with us through the Site that is password-protected, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns "categories" of personal information collected, we can request from you two data points of personal information to verify your identity. If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns specific personal information or sensitive personal information, we can request from you at least three data points of personal information as well as a signed declaration with penalty of perjury to verify your identity.</p>
<p>Please note that following your verified request, we will send you your personal information from the following email address: customersupportrep@viz.com (Any response to your request, including any personal information, may be sent as an encrypted file).</p>
<p>Please note that once you have submitted a Request to Know, Request to Delete or Request to Correct, we will send you a receipt, acknowledging your request, within 10 business days. If, for some reason, you do not receive such a receipt within 10 business days of your submitted request, please send us an email to <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com">privacypolicy@viz.com</a> as an error may have occurred.</p>
<p>We will process and respond to your Request to Know, Request to Delete or Request to Correct within 45 calendar days after it is received (in some cases, as is allowed under the CCPA, this process may be extended by an additional 45 calendar days).</p>
<p>Please note, that you can only make two Requests to Know in a 12-month period.</p>
<p>As a California resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. We may require proof that you have designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your identity directly with us. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com">privacypolicy@viz.com</a> for more information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent.</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, we may not deny you goods or services for that reason, or subject you to different prices than those paid by other consumers, unless provided otherwise under the CCPA, federal, or state law.</p>
