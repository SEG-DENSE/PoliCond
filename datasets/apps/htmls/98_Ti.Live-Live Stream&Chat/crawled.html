      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: Dec, 2023</p>
      <p>
        This Ti.Live Privacy Policy explains how Ti.Live (“Ti.Live” “we” “us”)
        process any personal data we collect from visitors and users of Ti.Live
        APP, services provided in relation to the applications and website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and
        others who visit and use the Ti.Live Services (collectively or
        individually, “you” or “users”) and want you to be familiar with how we
        collect, use, and disclose personal information from and about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may share personal information when using the Ti.Live Services. One
        example is when you provide information about yourself as part of the Ti
        Live account creation process. Another is when you take certain actions
        on the Ti.Live Services that are public or intended to be public in
        nature, such as when you broadcast content, post profile information,
        follow a channel, or subscribe to a broadcast channel. Given the social
        nature of some of the Ti.Live Services, that information may be
        collected, used, or disclosed by others who are part of that social
        interaction. In addition, some features of the Ti.Live Services are
        designed to provide others with information about user activity, such as
        identifying the user who created a particular Clip or the subscription
        status of users for a iven channel. We encourage you to be mindful of
        this when considering your activity on the Ti.Live Services.

      <h5>Data Security</h5>
      <p>
        We take appropriate administrative, technical and physical security
        measures to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access
        and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to
        access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted
        business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission
        of certain your Personal Information between your system and ours, and
        we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining
        access to your Personal Information. Please be advised, however, that we
        cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and
        transmission of your Personal Information. You should use caution
        whenever submitting information through Ti.Live Services and take
        special care in deciding which information you provide us with.

      <h5>User Generated Content</h5>
      <p>
        For user generated content, we will conduct strict review and
        management. The management methods for UGC content are as follows:
      </p>

      <p>i.Permitted content</p>
      <p>
        Ti.Live allows users to distribute streaming live, use services, such as
        chat, bulletin boards, forum postings, voice interactive services, and
        to participate in other activities in which you may create, post,
        transmit, perform, or store content, messages, text, sound, images,
        applications, code or other data or materials on the Services (“User
        Content”). Users of the Services may also overlay music, graphics,
        stickers, virtual items and other features provided by Ti.Live (“Ti Live
        Features”) onto this User Content and transmit this User Content through
        the Services. The views expressed by other users on the Services
        (including through use of the virtual gifts) do not represent our views
        or values.
      </p>
      <p>ii.Review and sanction regulations</p>
      <p>
        We employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced
        technical systems to detect misuse of our Services, harmful conduct
        towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or
        protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we
        will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing
        content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling
        an account, or contacting law enforcement.
      </p>
      <h5>Retention of Your information</h5>
      <p>
        We will retain your Personal Information and other information for as
        long as you maintain your Ti.Live account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may request deletion of your account at any time through the Me &gt;
        Settings &gt; Account Management &gt; Delete Account in the app, or
        through sending email to info@vifun.info. Following such request with
        appropriate review by us, we will delete the data that it is not
        required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance,
        litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, we retain
        location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a reasonable
        period as may be necessary; while it retains such data, it may also use
        it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and
        research and development. In certain circumstances, we may be unable to
        delete your account, such as if there’s a balance on the account or an
        unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing
        deletion, we will delete the account as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also retain certain information if necessary for purposes of
        safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if we deactivate a
        user’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, we may
        retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from
        opening a new Ti.Live account in the future.
      </p>

        policy, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date
        version so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
