    <p align="center"><strong>Little Labs, Inc. Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Last Updated: 04/17/2015</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong></p>

    <p>
        Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind,
        we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding
        the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive
        through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
        third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are
        accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we
        define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this
        Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So,
        please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</strong></h1>

    <p>
        Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the
        Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We
        may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any
        material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those
        changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or
        other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to
        indicate when those changes will become effective.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>Information Collected or Received from You</strong></p>

    <p>
        Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve
        our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your
        Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and
        easily navigate our Services. We may also use your information to send
        you e-mails and materials that directly promote our Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Account Information</u> . If you create an Account, we’ll collect
        certain information that can be used to identify you (“<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>” or “ <strong>PII</strong>”), such as your name, email address,
        profile photograph and a short biography. If you create an Account using
        your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to
        access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your
        privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create
        an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also
        collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot
        be used by itself to identify you, such the country and city where you
        are located. If you create an Account on behalf of an organization,
        we’ll also collect your organization’s corporate name. When you register
        for any Paid Services, we’ll collect your credit card information or
        other billing information you provide to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</u> .
        Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection
        tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
    </p>

    <p>
        “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small text files that are placed on your
        hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both
        session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in
        to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our
        Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web
        traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our
        Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when
        you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most
        browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser
        options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before
        accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept
        Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
        Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also
        place their own Cookies on your hard drive, such as Google Analytics and
        Mixpanel. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies
        and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
        “<strong>Web Beacons</strong>” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or
        clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be
        included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or
        communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our
        Services and to monitor how many visitors view our Services. Unlike
        Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are
        typically embedded invisibly on web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Related to Use of the Services</u> . Our servers
        automatically record certain information about how a person uses our
        Services (we refer to this information as “<strong>Log Data</strong>”),
        including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a
        “<strong>User</strong>”). Log Data may include information such as a
        User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system,
        the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the
        pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time
        spent on those pages or features, search terms on the Services, the
        links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We
        use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage
        third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our
        Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring
        them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may also track the watch
        faces Account holders have created and watch faces on their own
        collection on the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</u> . We or third party
        services provider we engage will collect certain information that your
        mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier,
        user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as
        information about your use of our Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Location Information</u> . When you use our Services, we may collect
        and store information about your location by accessing your mobile
        device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location
        services on your device, or when you provide us your country and city
        during the registration process. We may use location information to
        improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to
        collect location information, you may disable that feature on your
        mobile device.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Transactional Information</u> . We may collect information about the
        transaction in which you engage using the Paid Services, which may
        include PII about you relating to the transaction in question.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Information that We Share with Third Parties</strong></h1>

    <p>
        We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you
        except as described below:
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Shared with </u>
        <u>the General Public or other </u>
        <u>Account holders.</u> When you create your profile, the general public
        and other Account holders will be able to view your profile information
        (including your name, photograph, biography and city or country).
        <u></u>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers</u> . We may engage
        third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide
        the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your
        PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Shared with Third Parties</u> . We may share aggregated
        information and non-identifying information with third parties for
        industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar
        purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</u> .
        Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered
        to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a
        result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or
        if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of
        business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your
        PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in
        connection with the transaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of
            Others</u>
        . We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private
        parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any
        information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
        private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
        appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including
        subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the
        property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general;
        and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or
        legally actionable activity.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Your Choices</strong></h1>

    <p>
        We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your
        PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you
        decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be
        able to access all of the features of the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Opt-Out</u> . We may periodically send you free newsletters and
        e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such
        promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to
        “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the
        e-mail you receive. We do need to send you certain communications
        regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those
        communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of
        Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Modifying Your Information</u> . You can access and modify the PII
        associated with your Account by editing your profile on your Account,
        but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our
        records or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</strong></p>

    <p>
        Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track”
        signals received from various web browsers.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The Security of Your Information</strong></p>

    <p>
        We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures
        designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you
        (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
        you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data.
        Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information
        over the Internet or storing information is completely secure.
        Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any
        information.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>

    <p>
        Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned
        or operated by third parties (each, a “<strong>Third-party Service</strong>”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or
        that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the
        owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the
        owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the
        content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party
        Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully
        review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.
    </p>

    <p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>

    <p>
        Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located
        outside of your state, province, country or other governmental
        jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in
        your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and
        choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United
        States and process it there.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong></p>

    <p>
        Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not
        knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have
        collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such
        information from our files as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

    <p>
        California residents may request and obtain from us, once a year, free
        of charge, a list of third parties, if any, to which we disclosed their
        PII for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and
        the categories of PII shared with those third parties. If you are a
        California resident and wish to obtain that information, please submit
        your request by sending us an email at support@facer.io with “California
        Privacy Rights” in the subject line.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>

    <p>

        our Privacy Policy.
