<p><b>Purpose and legal basis: </b><span style="font-weight:400">This is required for Toca Boca to be able to provide You with its services and functionalities. We have a legitimate interest in being able to access and provide these services and functionalities. We ensure that the processing this entails is necessary to pursue that interest, and that Our interest outweighs Your right not to have Your information processed for this purpose. You are entitled to object to this processing, for reasons connected to the circumstances in Your particular case. Please see </span><a href="#2YourRightsAsADataSubject"><span style="font-weight:400">Section 2</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> for more information about Your rights.</span></p>

<h1 id="8ThirdCountryTransfers"><span style="font-weight:400">8. THIRD COUNTRY TRANSFERS</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">In some cases Toca Boca might transfer personal data outside the EU and EEA, so-called third countries. For Our transfers to the US, Canada and UK following conditions apply:</span></p>

This means that We transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission. For example, We transfer the personal data described in </span><a href="#4WhatPersonalDataAreUsedForWhatPurposeAndWithWhichLegalBasis"><span style="font-weight:400">Section 4</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> </span><span style="font-weight:400">to service providers and partners based in Canada and UK.</span></li>

These clauses require the other party to protect Your data and to provide You with EU-level rights and protections. For example, We use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in </span><a href="#4WhatPersonalDataAreUsedForWhatPurposeAndWithWhichLegalBasis"><span style="font-weight:400">Section 4</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> to Our </span><span style="font-weight:400">service</span><span style="font-weight:400"> providers and partners which use servers in the US.

<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Exceptions in special situations apply, such as to fulfill a contract with You or Your consent to the specific transfer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">We also identify and use additional protections as needed for each data transfer. For example, We use technical protection measures, such as encryption and pseudonymization.</span></p>
<p></p>

We strive to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of Your personal data.
