This Policy explains how we collect and use your data and how you can control your information. Looking for a quick summary on our privacy practices? Check out this <a target="_self" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" href="/privacy/privacy-center">page</a> or this <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012325772308?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">video</a>. And if you’re looking for specific product privacy information, for example, how we process your Chats and Snaps, take a look at our <a target="_self" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" href="/privacy/privacy-by-product">Privacy by Product</a> page. In addition to these documents, we also show in-app notices that provide you more information about our products and services.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Transparency is one of our core values at Snap. We believe there shouldn’t be any surprises about the data we collect and how we use it — that’s why we’re upfront with how we process it. For example, we process your information to provide you a more personalized experience, including to show you content and information that is most relevant to your experience, as well as more relevant advertisements. Understanding your interests and preferences help us provide a better product experience.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Furthermore, we believe a personalized experience should not come at the expense of your privacy. Just like in real life, there are some moments you want to share privately with your close friends, and others that you want to share publicly. That’s why from day one our philosophy has been to delete content by default and to give Snapchatters control by providing the tools that allow them to decide what happens with their content, like who to share it with or when to save it.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">This Policy covers our Snapchat app as well as our other products, services, and features, such as Bitmoji, Spectacles, and our advertising and commerce initiatives. When you read "Services" in this Policy, we’re talking about all of them. Also, if you see us refer to our "Terms," we mean the <a href="https://snap.com/terms?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a> that you agree to when you sign up for our Services. Finally, if you see the term "Snapchatter" we are often using that as shorthand for any user of our Services.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Let’s get started with the controls you have over your information:</p></div></div></div></div></section></section></div></article><article id="control-over-your-information" class="sdsm-block sdsm-tertiary css-1rfsqf4"><div data-testid="sdsm-block-boundary" class="sdsm-block-boundary css-1bzb5d8"><section data-test-id="sdsm-block-children" data-max-columns="1" class="css-l6mpse"><section data-test-id="sdsm-content" class="sdsm-content css-i3ci6a"><div data-test-id="sdsm-content-header-and-body" class="css-1bwj8xn"><div data-test-id="sdsm-content-header" class="css-kgx5cq"><h3 class="css-1gjh0sr" data-test-id="sdsm-content-title" data-animation-id="content-title"><p class="css-r44k6v">Control Over Your Information</p></h3></div><div data-test-id="sdsm-content-body"><div class="css-1g8v6r8" data-test-id="sdsm-content-body-content" data-animation-id="content-body"><div data-test-id="mwp-rich-text" class="css-is8b0c"><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p"><i>Control over your information and settings is a core part of Snapchat experience.

Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your permission.</i></p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">When you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you provide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some cases receive data from others. Let’s break these down in more detail.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Information You Provide</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Many of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you to provide us with <u>account details</u> (information about you, like your name, username, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your profile, you’ll also provide us with <u>profile details</u> (like your Bitmoji and profile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask you for <u>payment and related information</u> (like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment information, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Of course, you’ll also provide us with the information you send through or save within our Services. We consider some of this information to be <u>private content and communications</u> (like Snaps and Chats with friends, My Story set to Friends, Private Stories, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes Only). On the other end of the spectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services may be <u>public content</u> that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story content, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community Stories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information). Keep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the Snapchat app. So please don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Lastly, when you <u>contact Support</u> (content and communications shared with Support) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way, including through our <u>research efforts</u> (like responses to surveys, consumer panels, or other research questions) we’ll collect whatever information you provide or that we need to resolve your question.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Information We Generate When You Use Our Services</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">When you use our Services, we collect information about which of those Services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. This helps us better understand the way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">This includes <u>usage information</u> (information about how you interact with our Services — for example, which Lenses you view and apply, Stories you watch, and how often you communicate with other Snapchatters) and <u>content information</u> (information about content you create or provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your interactions with My AI, and metadata — for example, information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it). <u>Content information</u> includes information based on the content of the image, video, or audio — so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use that information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">This also includes <u>device information</u> (such as your hardware or software, operating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your device or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones connected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections), <u>location information</u> (IP address), <u>information collected by cookies and similar technologies</u>, depending on your settings, (cookies, <u>web beacons</u> (small graphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and <u>log information</u> (such as details about how you’ve used our Services, access times, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">If you’ve explicitly granted device-level permissions, <u>device information</u> may also include information about your <u>device phonebook</u> (contacts and related information), images and other information from your device’s <u>camera, photos, and microphone</u> (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored photos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording video), and <u>location information</u> (precise location through methods like GPS signals).</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Data We Receive From Others</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">The last category of data we collect is information about you that we may receive from others, such as other users, our <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7047492876308?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">affiliates</a>, and third parties. This includes <u>linked third-party service data</u> (information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service), <u>data from advertisers</u> (information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance of ads), <u>contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties</u> (if another Snapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may combine that with other information we have about you to better understand who you may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact information, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in other ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and <u>data relating to potential violations of our Terms</u> (we may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Other Information, With Your Permission</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Additionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information.

Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you’d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table </i><a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/22535044112532?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=snap&amp;utm_campaign=priv_prod&amp;lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Keep Things Up &amp; Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services)</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighborhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they’re sharing their location with you. We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Personalize Your Experience &amp; Give Context</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term “dog,” show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory, and inform us that you’re into dogs so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Personalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favorite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Our goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">For example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters’ expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs). We do not use the <u>private content and communications</u> you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Provide Relevant Ads</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Another way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We use your interests and preferences from the information we’ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they’re relevant. That’s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time. For example, if you’ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won’t be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won’t be interested in. For example, if a ticketing site tells us you’ve previously bought tickets for a movie — we can stop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012345515796?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">You can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes <a target="_self" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" href="/privacy/ads-privacy">here</a>.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">A note about <u>information collected by cookies and other technologies</u>: we may use these technologies to collect information when you interact with Services we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use information collected on an advertiser’s website to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices, please check out our <a href="https://www.snap.com/cookie-policy/?lang=en-US" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Develop &amp; Improve Features, Algorithms &amp; Machine Learning Models</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Our teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to improve our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the algorithms and <u>machine learning models</u> (an expression of an algorithm that combs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make predictions) that make our features and Services work, including through <u>generative AI features</u> (artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and <u>machine learning models</u> for personalization, advertising, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and <u>machine learning models</u> take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI to improve the responses from My AI.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Your information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make, but we are always focused on privacy — and we don’t want to use more of your personal information than necessary to develop our features and models.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Analytics</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">In order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need to understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor metadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should change parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data from Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the Services. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We perform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyze trends and usage. Based on this information, we will, among other things, create information about our users to help us understand demand.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Research</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends, and how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This information, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand more about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of those in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop new techniques and technologies (e.g., new <u>machine learning models</u> or hardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used in features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like overall behaviors and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data across our user base, and not contain any private information about you specifically).</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Enhance the Safety &amp; Security of Our Services</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services, verify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help protect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any suspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage is potentially harmful, and can give you a warning about it.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Contacting You</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Sometimes we’ll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features. This includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use the Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share information about our Services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">Other times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts, or to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may include sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates, security alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include fulfilling our user’s request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-Snapchatters.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Support</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">When you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In order to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners with the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use the information we have collected to respond.</p><div class="sdsm-h3 css-85zy81"><b>Enforce Our Terms &amp; Policies</b></div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">We use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes enforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms, policies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and complying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is posted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies.

For example, if you store something in Memories, we will keep it as long as you need it, but when you Chat with a friend, our systems are designed to delete Chats you send within 24 hours after your friend reads it (or automatically after viewing — depending on your settings). Whether we retain your data depends on the specific feature, your settings, and how you’re using the Services. Here are some more factors we consider when we decide how long to keep your information:</p><ul class="css-1j4b859 sdsm-ul"><li><div class="css-1wp78br sdsm-li"><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">If we need the information to operate or provide our Services.

For example, we maintain your list of friends until you ask us to delete them since friends are key to expressing yourself. Conversely, Snaps and Chats sent in Snapchat will be deleted by default from our servers within 24 hours after we detect they’ve been opened by all recipients or have expired, unless you’ve changed your default settings or decide to save something, in which case we will honor your choices.</p></div></li><li><div class="css-1wp78br sdsm-li"><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">The information itself. For example, we store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which Services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap — like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map or Spotlight — we’ll retain that location as long as we store the Snap.
