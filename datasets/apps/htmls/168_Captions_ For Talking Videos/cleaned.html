To provide these features, we collect additional information about objects contained in user-generated content, including using advanced technology such as artificial intelligence to better understand the size, shape, and location of an object in space. If the user-generated content contains an image of you, we may automatically generate information about your physical characteristics to place digital content on top of or around you, such as identifying the location of your eyes, nose, mouth and ears to generate a digital overlay for your face. We may also use this information for authentication for certain features of the Service. If you have any questions about how this technology works, please contact us as set forth below in the <a href="https://www.captions.ai/privacy/policy#contact-us">Contact Us</a> section.</p><h3><strong>Children’s Personal Information</strong></h3><p>The services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16.

Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.  You may be required to provide additional information to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.  </p><p>Applicable law may also permit you to appeal any denials of your rights requests; to do so, contact us at using the information in the “Contact Us” section below and describe in detail why you believe the denial was in error. Your description must include your full name and the email address to obtain the Services from us, along with a copy of the denial notice you received from us.</p><p>You may also have the right to opt out of the use of your information for targeted advertising.  Targeted advertising (as defined by applicable law) is advertising based on a consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites to predict the consumer’s preferences or interests.  You may also have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your information, as that term is defined by applicable law.  To opt out of targeted advertising or “sales,” please visit this link: <a href="mailto:legal@captions.ai?subject=Do%20Not%20Sell%20or%20Share%20My%20Personal%20Information">Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</a>.  You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.</p><p>If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.</p><h3><strong>Data Retention</strong></h3><p>We will retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for the other purposes set out in this Policy. We also store information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate interest to do so (such as improving and developing our Services, and enhancing the safety, security, and stability of our Services).  We may also store your information in order to defend or ascertain our legal rights, respond to valid legal requests, in the context of a merger/acquisition or in order to implement our Terms and Conditions. <br/>In all cases, in addition to the purposes, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, in determining how long to retain personal data. <strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>Data Security</strong></h3><p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are designed to protect the privacy and security of personal information. However, the Internet is not a fully secure environment, and we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any information transmitted to or generated by Captions in connection with the Services or any other service offered by Captions. You play a critical role in protecting your information by maintaining up-to-date computer security protections. Steps you take to ensure the security of your computer, computer passwords, or other personal identifier authentication mechanisms are key components of the protection of your personal information. You agree that you are responsible for any additional verification procedures and security you deem necessary.</p><h3><strong>Notice To Persons Located Outside The United States</strong></h3><p>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world and where the information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities of that jurisdiction.  Your information may be transferred for processing and storage by Captions and our affiliates and third parties.  Where required, we will use appropriate safeguards for transferring data outside of your jurisdiction. This includes signing Standard Contractual Clauses that govern the transfers of such data, which may be used in conjunction with additional safeguards. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as detailed in the “Contact us” section below.</p><h3><strong>Notice To California Residents – Your Privacy Rights</strong></h3><p>If you’re a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties to whom we disclose personal information. </p><p>Throughout this Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we disclose it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for “business or commercial purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). The categories of personal information are identifiers (such as name, address, and email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information); internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address and browsing history); geolocation information (general location and, with your consent, precise location); inference data about you; audio and visual information (such as when you upload or record audio or video using the Services); legally protected classifications (such as gender); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.  The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password, financial data, or other credentials allowing access to your account, as well as biometric information.  .</p><p>We or our service providers collect and disclose the above categories of personal information for the purposes described in our Policy. This includes the following business and commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law):</p><ul role="list"><li>Provide the Services (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, order processing and fulfillment, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the Service);</li><li>Operational purposes (e.g., to enable and troubleshoot our Service);</li><li>Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions);</li><li>Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents and fraudulent or illegal activity;</li><li>Bug detection, error reporting, and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our Service;</li><li>Short-term, transient use, such as customizing content that we or our service providers display on the Service;</li><li>Improving our existing Services and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop new products or features);</li><li>Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and communicating with you about relevant offers from third-party partners;</li><li>Other uses about which we notify you.</li></ul><p>We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; and (3) third parties such as social media services, advertisers, influencers, publishers, service providers, information providers, and publicly available sources.</p><p>We describe our information disclosure practices in the Policy above. We may disclose certain categories of information to third parties (as defined by the CCPA) for the business purposes described above. For example, we may disclose information designated for sharing to other users and the general public.</p><h3><strong><em>Rights Of California Consumers</em></strong></h3><p>If you’re a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:</p><ul role="list"><li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” your personal information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell,” or with whom we “share,” personal information; and the categories of personal information we “sell.”</li><li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li><li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li><li>Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.</li></ul><p>You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights.

If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.</p><p>If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request by emailing us at legal@captions.ai  You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.  To do so, you will be required to log into your account or provide us information such as your name and email address.  We may request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.  You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p><p>The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties’ cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics and advertising services, these technologies may access identifiers (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Services), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering the use of our Services) to those sorts of companies. While we do not believe these are “sales” as that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity.  </p><p>The CCPA also requires businesses that "share“ personal information to provide an opt out from such sharing.  Under the CCPA,” sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites.  We “share” information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services.  As part of this advertising, we may "share“ identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering a subscription to the Services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks.  To opt out of such “sharing,” please visit this link: <a href="mailto:legal@captions.ai?subject=Do%20Not%20Sell%20or%20Share%20My%20Personal%20Information"><strong>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</strong></a>.</p><p>Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control.  Any opt out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them. For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see www.globalprivacycontrol.org.</p><p>We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16.</p><p>The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes.  Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.</p><h3><strong><em>Retention Of Your Personal Information </em></strong></h3><p>Please see the “Data Retention” section above.</p><h3><strong><em>Notice Of Financial Incentive</em></strong></h3><p>In addition to the practice described in “disclosure to third-parties to enable artificial intelligence-based features” section above, we may provide certain rewards or incentives for providing your email address or referring friends and contacts, and may occasionally run sweepstakes and contests where participants may provide personal information in return for a chance to win or compete to win certain prizes. You can opt into these incentives, sweepstakes, or contests by taking the requested action. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw from these incentives at any time. If you decide you don’t want to participate in these financial incentives, you can refrain from taking the requested actions.  </p><p>The specific reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you provide the information requested or submit a review. The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of the information you provide us. We have arrived at this estimate based on consideration of multiple factors, including the following: (1) revenue generated by Captions in developing insights on our customers; (2) expenses incurred by Captions in operating the incentives; and (3) our reasonable assessment of revenue we may generate as a result of the referrals provided to us by our customers.</p><h3><strong><em>Shine The Light</em></strong></h3><p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the “Shine the Light” law), users who are residents of California may request information regarding the disclosure of our personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@captions.ai">legal@captions.ai</a>.</p><h3><strong><em>Removal Of User-Generated Content</em></strong></h3><p>Users of the platform who are California residents under the age of 18 may request and obtain removal of user-generated content they posted on the platform. To submit such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@getcaptions.app">legal@captions.ai</a>. Please note that a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material. For example, materials that were posted may have been republished or reposted by another user or third party.</p><h3><strong>Nevada Residents</strong></h3><p>If you are a resident of the State of Nevada, Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a Nevada resident to opt out of future sales of certain covered information that a website operator has collected or will collect about the resident. To submit such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@getcaptions.app">legal@captions.ai</a>.</p><h3><strong>Colorado Residents</strong></h3><p>For more information regarding how each category of data is processed and disclosed and to whom the data is disclosed, please <a href="https://www.captions.ai/privacy/eea">click here.</a></p><h3><strong><em>Sales Of Personal Information</em></strong></h3><p>The Colorado Privacy Act (COPA) requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the COPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales.  Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties’ cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics and advertising services, these technologies may access identifiers (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Services), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering the use of our Services) to those sorts of companies. While Captions does not believe these are “sales” as that term is defined under the COPA, you can opt out of this activity as described in the “your rights” section above.</p><h3><strong><em>Targeted Advertising</em></strong></h3><p>We may may also use your information to send you targeted advertising (as that term is defined in the COPA).  We disclose identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering using the Services) with advertising platforms and advertising networks for this purpose.  You can opt out of this activity as described in the “your rights” section above.</p><h3><strong>UK and EEA Residents</strong></h3><p>If you are based in the United Kingdom (“UK”), European Economic Area ("EEA"), please <a href="https://www.captions.ai/privacy/eea">click here for additional privacy disclosures.</a></p><h3><strong>Updates To This Privacy Policy</strong></h3><p>We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
