We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on an eero Site. We also use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear GIFs, web beacons or web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images or snippets of code with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to tell whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. To learn more about cookies, clear GIFs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit <a href="https://cookiesandyou.com/">https://cookiesandyou.com/</a>. Cookies, Pixel Tags and other technology are used to analyze how users use an eero Site and Products, to make an eero Site more useful, to track online movements of web users, and to tailor the experience with us to meet special interests and needs.<br/><br/><br/>We permit third-party advertising partners to use Cookies, Pixel Tags and other technology to collect information about your eero Site browsing activities over time and across different websites when you use our eero Site. For example, we use advertising services provided by third-party ad partners to market our services to you on other websites and online services. Through a process called “retargeting,” each service places a Cookie on your browser when you visit an eero Site so that they can identify you and serve you ads on other sites around the web based on your browsing activity.<br/><br/><br/>If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from an eero Site for any of the purposes described above, then you can manage your Cookie and web browser Pixel Tag settings by (a) going to our Cookie preferences settings on an eero Site (the “Cookie Controls”) or (b) managing the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools (“Browser Settings”).<br/><br/><br/>To avoid use of information for advertising by third-party ad partners (as described above), you can use the Cookie Controls, or change your Browser Settings to reject cookies or to notify you when cookies are set, and you could select the “Do Not Track” option on your browser, though we have no control over and cannot confirm whether these third party ad parties honor the Do Not Track browser signal. Additionally, many advertising companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or Digital Advertising Alliance and/or provide opt-outs on those industry pages. To learn how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising in the USA, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>.<br/><br/><br/>If you do not accept certain cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of the eero Site(s) or all functionality of the eero Site(s). If you have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided above.</p></li></ol><p></p></article></div></div></div></section></div><div class="eo-Footer navy-bg"><div class="row top center end@m"><div class="col-18 col-16@m prefix-1 col-20@xs suffix-1 col-14@s no-gutter footer-margin"><div class="logo Logo_logo__5xyYV Logo_logo-white__xJBsE Logo_logo-normal__DvYGt"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/" title="eero"><span class="sc-20c5748e-0 NSQQh" data-sentry-component="VisuallyHidden" data-sentry-element="VisHidden" data-sentry-source-file="index.tsx">eero</span></a></div></div><div class="col-10 col-14@m prefix-1@xs col-20@xs prefix-1 suffix-1 footer-margin no-gutter"><div class="FooterNav"><div class="row no-wrap start@m"><div class="col-8 col-10@m column"><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/shop" role="navigation">Products</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/experience" role="navigation">Experience</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/technology" role="navigation">Technology</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/eero-built-in" role="navigation">eero Built-in</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/eero-plus" role="navigation">eero Plus</a></div> <div class="footer-nav-link"><a href="https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us#wifi_support" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="navigation" target="_blank">Support</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/find-your-system" role="navigation">Find your system</a></div></div><div class="col-10 column"><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/esp" role="navigation">for Service Providers</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/pro-installers" role="navigation">for Pro Installers</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/business" role="navigation">for Business</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/eero-for-communities" role="navigation">for Communities</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/careers" role="navigation">Careers</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a href="//blog.eero.com#wifi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blog</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/press" role="navigation">Media room</a></div><div class="footer-nav-link"><a data-sentry-component="NavLink" data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="NavLink.tsx" href="/legal/tos" role="navigation">Legal</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="col-8 col-15@m prefix-1@m col-21@xs footer-margin"><div class="row"><div class="col-21"><div class="NewsletterSignup"><h3>Connect with us</h3><p>for the latest eero news and promotions.</p><p class="error-message hide">Oops!
