<p><b>Advertising.</b></p>
<p>We may show ads in our Services to enable you to access content in our Services free of charge. In order to show you ads in our Services, we may integrate SDKs into our Services provided by third-party ad partners. These third-party ad partners may show contextual or personalized ads based on your privacy preferences and whether you have opted-out of receiving personalized ads in the Service’s privacy settings. Please see a list of our third-party partners by clicking <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here for more information.</a></span></p>
<p>Where you have not opted-out of receiving personalized advertising, these third-party SDKs may collect your IP address, device ID, performance data, advertising data, non-user-related crash logs, data relating to how you interact with our Service, and other statistical and technical information in order to serve ads relevant to you.</p>
<p>Where you have opted-out of personalized advertising, these third-party SDKs may collect non-personal, contextual data including geolocation data, query terms and content on the Service. They may also collect your advertising ID solely for the purposes of frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and combating fraud and abuse. Our ad partners may use your information for a number of purposes, including but not limited to, to personalize the ads that you see to make sure they are relevant to your own interests, diagnose problems and improve the SDK, understand the effectiveness of existing product features and plan new features, measure and improve the performance of ads as well as the effectiveness of the Service’s features, as well as for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>For information on how to opt-out from personalized advertisements, see section ‘Your rights’ below.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">WHO CAN SEE YOUR DATA</span></h4>
<p><b>Instead of doing absolutely everything on our own, we need help from others. We have partners that provide services and data processing for us for the purposes described in this notice. We share your data with the following types of recipients:</b></p>
<p><b>Social Features. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have social features in our Services, which means that other users may, for example, see your&nbsp; profile data and your leaderboard position or other activities in the Services, and read or comments or questions you post in our forums.</span></p>
<p><b>Yousician Companies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies belonging to the Yousician group of companies, for example to help us to develop or operate our Services</span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Partners working for us. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persons or companies outside of the Yousician group that process personal data on our behalf and according to our instructions and control. These Yousician processor partners include for example providers of hosting services, payment processors that actually deal with billing, banks and credit card companies on behalf of us, analytics services that enable us to gain insight into how we should improve our Services, user support and other services that help us to operate and develop our Services.</span></p>
<p><b>Advertising and social media. </b>P<span style="font-weight: 400;">artners who use advertising identifiers, cookies, Application Programming Interfaces, and/or SDKs in our Service to enable them to collect and analyze user and device related data and information. Such partners may be for example, our advertising partners or partners providing social media tools allowing sharing of content from our Services. These partners collect and process personal data separately from us under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to check those privacy policies to learn more about their data collection and use practices, use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies. The opt-out instructions for these Partners’ services are also included in their privacy policies. For any details on the processing of personal data by our advertising and social media partners, please check <a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here for more information.</a></span></p>
<p><b>Public authorities and other entities.&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">competent law enforcement bodies or courts of law where we find it necessary as a matter of applicable law or regulation,&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential or actual buyers or their advisors in connection with a planned or actual corporate acquisition or other business restructuring or a similar arrangement,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to any person or entity where we find disclosure necessary to combat fraud or illegal activity, or to exercise or defend our legal rights or to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">INTERNATIONAL DATA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TRANSFERS&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Service is global by nature, and your data can therefore be transferred to and processed in countries outside of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For example, our subsidiaries and some of the servers we use to host our Services are located in the USA. We also use partners that are located outside the EU to provide services for us. Since these countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal data. These safeguards may include having </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standard contractual clauses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved by the EU Commission or other lawful safeguards in place. For more details as regards our international advertising and social media partners, please check <a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here for more information</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DATA RETENTION</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We retain your data as long as your user account is active or as needed to provide the Services. You may end this relationship by deleting your account. We will then delete all your personal data from our own and our partners’ systems, including backups within 30 days, unless there is a legitimate business interest to retain the data, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements or to resolve disputes. We also periodically review and delete or de-identify inactive user accounts that have been inactive for five years or other data.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">YOUR RIGHTS</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to access your personal data we store about you. If you request, we will provide you a copy of your personal data in an electronic format. You also have the right to have your data deleted.
