<p><b>Advertising.</b></p>
<p>We may show ads in our Services to enable you to access content in our Services free of charge.

<p><b>Social Features. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have social features in our Services, which means that other users may, for example, see your  profile data and your leaderboard position or other activities in the Services, and read or comments or questions you post in our forums.</span></p>
<p><b>Yousician Companies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies belonging to the Yousician group of companies, for example to help us to develop or operate our Services</span><b>  </b></p>
<p><b>Partners working for us. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persons or companies outside of the Yousician group that process personal data on our behalf and according to our instructions and control. These Yousician processor partners include for example providers of hosting services, payment processors that actually deal with billing, banks and credit card companies on behalf of us, analytics services that enable us to gain insight into how we should improve our Services, user support and other services that help us to operate and develop our Services.</span></p>

<p><b>Public authorities and other entities. </b></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to any person or entity where we find disclosure necessary to combat fraud or illegal activity, or to exercise or defend our legal rights or to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">INTERNATIONAL DATA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TRANSFERS </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Service is global by nature, and your data can therefore be transferred to and processed in countries outside of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For example, our subsidiaries and some of the servers we use to host our Services are located in the USA. We also use partners that are located outside the EU to provide services for us. Since these countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal data. These safeguards may include having </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standard contractual clauses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved by the EU Commission or other lawful safeguards in place. For more details as regards our international advertising and social media partners, please check <a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here for more information</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DATA RETENTION</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We retain your data as long as your user account is active or as needed to provide the Services. You may end this relationship by deleting your account. We will then delete all your personal data from our own and our partners’ systems, including backups within 30 days, unless there is a legitimate business interest to retain the data, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements or to resolve disputes. We also periodically review and delete or de-identify inactive user accounts that have been inactive for five years or other data.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">YOUR RIGHTS</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to access your personal data we store about you. If you request, we will provide you a copy of your personal data in an electronic format. You also have the right to have your data deleted. If you choose to delete your profile, this will erase all personal data we have collected of you through the application thereby also anonymising all analytics data based on such personal data, unless we, for a legitimate reason, have the right to retain the personal data. You can also demand the restriction of processing in accordance with the legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To access your data in our applications, or to request its deletion, please send a data access or deletion request from the application settings under the “privacy” menu or through your user profile page. We ask you to primarily use these automatic tools to submit requests to help us to validate and process your requests more quickly and reliably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Yousician app provides the possibility to control some of the social features of the app and what data you share with others. You can modify your preferences in the settings under the privacy tab of the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also have the right to correct or update your information. You may do this by editing your personal details on your profile if your information changes or happens to be incorrect. Or you can contact us at </span><a href="mailto:support@yousician.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@yousician.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also have the right to object to our processing of your information to the extent our processing is based on legitimate interests. You can at any time ask us to stop using your information to send you marketing communications. In the Yousician application, you are able to modify your preferences concerning marketing communications (push and email) under the privacy tab in the Yousician application’s settings or by following the instructions in such communications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any consent that you might have provided can be withdrawn at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For limiting interest based advertising, please check out your ad tracking settings of your mobile device or web browser. For your Android or iOS device, select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android) in the settings. For opting out of targeted advertising on the web, you can adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking by cookies or by visit </span><a href="https://www.youradchoices.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.youradchoices.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or </span><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.networkadvertising.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where applicable, you may also opt-out from receiving personalized ads through the options provided in the Service’s privacy settings. When you decide to opt-out of receiving personalized ads, you may still be served ads in the Service by our ad partners, however, these ads will be based on contextual data and may be less relevant to you.
