</p>
<p>
            Please note that all third parties that are engaged in processing

            <a href="https://bpmob.com/sphonefree/support/">support form</a>. In
            most cases there is no way to maintain the App’s further operating
            without functional data therefore you will be advised to remove the

<p></p>
<p>REQUESTS<br/></p>
<p>
            To submit a verifiable consumer request for access, portability or
            deletion of personal data please contact us through the
            <a href="https://bpmob.com/sphonefree/support/">support form</a>.
            Please include in the text of your appeal the wording "Your rights
            to maintain confidentiality in the state of California”.<br/>
</p>
<p>When submitting a verifiable request, you should be ready to:</p>
<p>
            • Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative, which may include: name, address,
            city, state, and zip code and email address. We may use this
            information to surface a series of security questions to you to
            verify your identity. If you are making a request through an
            authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must
            provide written authorization confirming or a power of attorney,
            signed by you.
          </p>
<p>
            • Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. <br/>
</p>
<p>
            We will not be able to respond to your request or provide you with
            personal information if we cannot: (i) verify your identity or
            authority to make the request; or (ii) confirm that the personal
            information relates to you. We may ask you for additional
            information or documents to verify your identity. We may also carry
            out checks, including with third party identity verification
            services, to verify your identity before taking any action with your
            personal information. This is regarded as a safeguard measure to
            prevent disclosure of your personal information under a fake or scum
            request.
          </p>
<p>
            We ensure that personal information provided in a verifiable
            consumer request will be used only to verify the requestor’s
            identity or authority to make the request and not for any other
            purpose. We will keep it for the adequate term reasonably needed for
            the purpose described above and delete after the purpose is
            fulfilled.  
          </p>
<p>
            We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five
            (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform
            you of the reason and extension period in writing. Please note that
            we are only required to respond to two requests per customer each
            year.
          </p>
<p></p>
<p>EQUAL RIGHTS<br/></p>
<p>
            Nothing in the way we deal with your request shall be interpreted as
            discrimination, which means that we will not set up different
            pricing or products, or different level or quality of services for
            you, if you choose to exercise your rights. However, in some
            circumstances, we may not be able to provide services if you choose
            to delete your personal information from our records.<br/>
</p>
<p>SALE OF DATA<br/></p>
<p>
            We do not sell any of your personal data to third parties.<br/>
</p>
<p id="part-ii"><strong>II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>
            There are several categories of information that can be processed.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>Functional information, Information that you submit </strong>
</p>
<p>
            We ask for and collect the following personal information about you
            when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate
            <strong>performance of the contract</strong> between you and us.
            Without such information it is impossible to provide complete
            functionality of the App and perform the requested services.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Authorization and/or Account Information:</strong> email
              and other data (name, address) that is needed for compliance with
              applicable local laws. Please mind that in some countries due to
              specific local regulation, addresses are validated to ensure the
              integrity and accuracy of the data provided.
            </li>
</ul>
<p>You may create an Account and register within the App by choosing the option Sign in with Apple and providing your email address. Having an Account will enable you to sign in to the App on any device using your Apple ID and sign out at any time. You can also choose to delete your Account within the App at any time, using the App’s settings. In this case all your data within the App will be lost and you’ll no longer be able to access such data. Bear in mind that if you have a valid subscription, deleting your Account within the App will not cancel it. When you delete your Account we might keep storing certain information as a data backup measure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activity Information</strong>, e.g. your contacts created
              through the App, call logs and recordings of calls, logs and
              records of text messages, origination and termination points (i.e.
              to/from numbers), history of incoming and outgoing calls performed
              and the content of messages sent/received with the help of the
              App, the list of second phone numbers you ever used through the
              App. Upon your consent we also may have technical access to the
              microphone and contact list on your device.
            </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all your <strong>Authorization and/or Account Information</strong> and <strong>Activity Information</strong> are processed exclusively to the extent necessary to operate the App services and provide you with the App functionality (i.e. to make and receive phone calls, to record your calls, to send and receive SMS/MMS messages, to manage contacts and view message history). Only you can exercise full control over your personal information. If you choose to delete your Account within the App, you’ll no longer be able to access and/or restore all above listed categories of information.</p>
<p>
            Note that if you use a call recording feature within the App it is
            your sole responsibility to warn your dialog partner that you are
            going to record a call. For more information about the rules you
            must follow when you record any call using the App please check
            subsection “Specific requirements and legal considerations
            concerning call recording feature” in Section VII of our
            <a class="terms" href="https://bpmob.com/sphonefree/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
          </p>
<p>
            We process this information by ourselves. However, we may also
            engage  third parties - Twilio Inc. and Telnyx LLC - for storing this personal
            data in order to fulfill obligations and deliver the full scope of
            services. This personal data can be deleted either by a third
            party in accordance with our instructions or by our own means.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Contact Information </strong>(name, e-mail address, as
              well as any other content included in the email) which you may
              fill in by yourself when you contact us via email, support form.
              We collect, store and process it by our cloud storage provider
              (Amazon.com, Inc.). We  use  such information to respond
              effectively to your inquiry, fulfill your requests, send you
              communications that you request and perform the requested
              services.
            </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Information That Is Processed Automatically </strong>
</p>
<p>
            On the basis of your <strong>permission</strong> we use third-party
            automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics
            tools) to analyze certain information sent by your device via our
            App (<strong>Identity For Advertisers for iOS devices/ Advertising ID or
              Android ID for Android devices</strong>). Some integrated advertising or analytics tools (check Section IV
            to see the list of them) launch automated processing of your
            personal data, including profiling, which means any form of
            automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain
            personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or
            predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests,
            behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described
            below). Processing information through automatic data processing
            technologies starts automatically once you allow our App to track
            your activity. You can withdraw your permission at any time - please
            check opt-out options in Section VIII below.
          </p>
<p>
            We may process some information about your device and your user
            behavior on the ground of our legitimate interests. This information
            falls within categories of data described above in Subsection
            “Information That Is Processed Automatically”, it is generally
            non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct
            association with any specific individual, and we may access it only
            in aggregated form. We use this information for improving our App
            and giving our users the best experience
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Device Details. </strong>When you use a mobile device
              (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, some details
              about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”.
              Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures
              stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
              identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device
              identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content
              and ads by the third parties.
            </li>
<p>What data can be processed:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: '➔ ';">
<li>
                Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of
                operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen
                size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery,
                device memory usage.
              </li>
<li>
                Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network
                provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of
                sessions, speed, browser. 
              </li>
<li>
                Location-related information: IP address, the country code/
                region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device,
                language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of
                interest (eg. “coffee shop”).
              </li>
<li>
                Other device identifiers: e.g. user identifiers (if they are set
                up by the App’s developer).
              </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<li>
<strong>Information about the applications</strong>. Name, API key
              (identifier for application), version,  properties of our App
              can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some
              services also record the list of applications and/or processes
              which are installed or run on your device.
            </li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> When you use
              the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web
              beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small
              amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you
              access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each
              time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more
              effectively. For example, we will know how many users access
              specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads
              they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand
              and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts,
              and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We
              may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to
              the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.
            </li>
<li>
<strong>Log file information. </strong>Log file information is
              automatically reported each time you make a request to access the
              App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your
              device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record
              certain log file information, including time and date when you
              start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
            </li>
<li>
<strong>Ad-related information</strong>. The following data might
              be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a
              particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked” or if
              it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about;
              what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad
              placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the
              App); whether you respond to the ad. 
            </li>
<li>
<strong>In-app events.</strong> When you use our App, analytics
              tools automatically record your activity information (tutorial
              steps, levelling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events,
              progression events, method of limiting the processing of user
              data).
            </li>
</ul>
<p>
            Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools
            does not generally come to our control, therefore we cannot be
            responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some
            services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain
            information related to your personality and/or your device by using
            technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. In
            case when your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook
            may use your device information in association with categorized data
            that was already recorded in its databases (eg. your age, gender or
            other demographic indication). We do not control, supervise or stand
            surety for how the third parties process your personal data, that
            might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Any
            information request regarding the disclosure of your personal
            information should be directed to such third parties (see Section
            IV).
          </p>
<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
<p>
            Our e-commerce provider (Apple) is responsible for billing,
            processing and charging for in-app purchases, handles your personal
            information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This
            information is processed as part of the performance of the contract
            between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit
            card information. You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase
            rules and policies directly from the app stores.
          </p>

            contained within them.
          </p>
<p>
            We may disclose your personal information if it is needed for
            objective reasons, due to the public interest or in other unforeseen
            circumstances:
          </p>
<p>- as required by law;</p>
<p>
            - when we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to
            protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
            investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
          </p>
<p>
            - if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
            portion of our assets, you will be notified via prominent notice in
            our App of any change in ownership or your personal information
            usage, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal
            information.
          </p>
<p><strong>V. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>
            We work in the cross-border area and provide our App to our Users
            around the world.
          </p>
<p>
            We and third-party organizations that provide automatic data
            processing technologies for the App or our third-party advertising
            partners may transfer the automatically processed information across
            borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
            jurisdictions around the world.
          </p>
<p>
            If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws
            governing data processing that may differ from U.S. law, please note
            that we may transfer information, including personal information, to
            a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data
            protection laws as in your jurisdiction.
          </p>
<p>
            This means that your personal information can be transferred to a
            third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within
            that third country, or to the international organization where data
            protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same
            level of protection of personal data as your country does.
          </p>
<p>
            We try to make sure that the recipient of any personal data provides
            a proper protection of the personal data received, in accordance
            with the current legislation on the protection of such information.
            By using the App, you agree that we may transfer your personal data
            to any third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors
            within that third country, or to the international organization.
          </p>
<p>
            For the purposes of data storage, we recourse to the services of the
            hosting organizations. We take your privacy seriously and,
            therefore, encrypt your personal data - if possible - before sending
            it to the hosting organizations for the purposes of its storage.
            Please note that we cooperate only with those hosting organizations
            that have passed our security and reliability check.
          </p>
<p><strong>VI. HOW LONG WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>
            We generally retain your personal information for as long as is
            necessary for performing the functional service of the App and to
            comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use
            your information that we physically access and store, you can
            request that we erase your personal information and close your
            account.
          </p>
<p>
            However, some data may still be stored for a certain time period
            (but no longer than the storage purpose requires) if information is
            necessary to comply with legal obligation (taxation, accounting,
            audit) or in order to maintain safety and data backup settings,
            prevent fraud or other malicious acts.<br/>

<p id="opt-out"><strong>VIII. HOW TO OPT OUT</strong><br/></p>
<p><strong>Opt-out of marketing tracking</strong><br/></p>
<p>You can manage your activity tracking permissions. Inter alia, if you don’t want third-party service providers to use to the personalized ads on the basis of your interests please follow the instructions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For iOS devices</strong>: go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) &gt; Tracking, then tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for a specific app.
              <br/>
              You can also control whether apps can ask for permission to track your activity. If you don’t want to be asked for your permission, or do not want apps to access your device’s Advertising Identifier, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) &gt; Tracking and then disable the “Allow Apps to Request to Track” switch. If you turn off "Allow Apps to Request to Track", you won't get prompts from apps that want to track your activity. Each app that asks for permission to track while this setting is turned off will be treated as if you tapped “Ask App Not to Track”. Please find additional information here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025</a> or in the Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) &gt; Tracking section on your device.
              <br/>
              If you want to disable Apple’s ad targeting, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) &gt; Apple Advertising, then set the “Personalized Ads” switch to the “off” position. Please find additional information here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
            You can also visit<a href="https://youradchoices.com/">
              https://youradchoices.com</a>
            for the same purpose.<br/>
</p>
<p>
            Please mind that when you opt out of certain interest based advertising,
            you may still continue to receive contextual ads based on other
            non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of
            other digital products you are using.
          </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Opt-out of Location Data Processing</strong><br/></p>
<p>
            If you don’t want third-party service providers to use your precise
            location data, or street-level location information about you please
            follow the instructions below:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
              For iOS devices: turn Location Services off for the applicable
              Product via the menu “Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security (or “Privacy” in earlier versions of iOS) &gt; Location
              Services”. Then select the applicable App and set the “Share My
              Location” status to “Never”. Please see additional information
              here:

            </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IХ. SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>
            The security of your personal information is highly important to us.
            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
            personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
            once we receive it.
          </p>
<p>
            We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal
            information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
            alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved
            in the processing and the nature of the personal information.
          </p>
<p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures,
            which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as
            data minimization, in an effective manner and to integrate the
            necessary safeguards into the processing. We seek your personal data
            to be encrypted with proper and strong encryption algorithms,
            including hashing where possible.
          </p>
<p>
            Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
            method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We do our best to
            protect your personal data, nevertheless, we cannot guarantee its
            absolute security. In the event that your personal information is
            compromised as a breach of security, we will promptly notify you in
            compliance with applicable law.
          </p>
<p>
            If you have any questions about the security of our App, you can
            contact us through the support form displayed below.
          </p>
<p><strong>X. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>Our App is not intended for children. Therefore, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit any personal information from children. For the purposes of this Section X the terms “child” and/or “children” in the context of data processing activities may be interpreted on a case-by-case basis as prescribed by applicable data protection laws. No one who is considered a “child” under applicable data protection laws is allowed to directly provide any personal information to the App.</p>
<p>As a general rule we consider a person under the age of 16 to be regarded as “a child” until we have legal grounds to conclude that a person under 16 should be treated as an adult as per provisions of local data protection rules or based on the parent authorization provided to us directly.</p>
<p>Solely the holders of parental responsibility are liable for preventing their children from providing personal information via the App without relevant verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will erase that information as quickly as possible. If you reasonably believe that we might have any information from or about a child, or a child has directly provided us with personal information via the App without verifiable parental consent, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>XI. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy policy is updated regularly.</p>
<p>
            Whenever we change this Privacy policy, we will post those changes
            to this Privacy policy and other places that we consider
            appropriate. Additional forms of notice of modifications or updates
            as appropriate under the circumstances may be provided to you.
          </p>
<p><strong>XII. HOW TO CONTACT US</strong></p>
<p>
